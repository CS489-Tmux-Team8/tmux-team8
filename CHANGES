* Use SM 2026 for Sync which is more widely supported now.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* next-prompt can have 1 argument.

* Allow attributes to have only two parameters, from Tim Culverhouse.

* Add combined character test.

* Restore utf8proc code.

* Reply to SMGRAPHICS.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Remove next- and previous-prompt added in error. GitHub issue 3696.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add -t to source-file, GitHub issue 3473.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Reset combine flag only if text is actually processed.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* If a pane is killed, cancel reading from the file. GitHub issue 3422.

* Add a missing space.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

However, since tmux was not correctly handling this on input, other programs also do not handle it correctly, and the alternative SGR mouse mode is now widespread, this seems unnecessary, so remove this feature. Also define some constants to make it clearer what the numbers mean. Mostly from Leonid S Usov in GitHub issue 3165.

A new command, server-access, configures the list. tmux gets the user using getpeereid(3) of the client socket. Users must still configure file system permissions manually. From Dallas Lyons and others.

* Fix property name, from Sergei Dyshel.

* Remove duplicates from completion list, GitHub issue 3178.

* Add pane_start_path to match start_command.

* Set PWD so shells have a hint about the real path (this was done before but lost in a merge). GitHub issue 3186.

* Better error reporting when applying custom layouts.

* Do not send focus sequences when focus is enabled or disabled by the application if it is turned off. GitHub issue 3142.

* For open/openat, if the flags parameter does not contain O_CREAT, the 3rd (variadic) mode_t parameter is irrelevant.  Many developers in the past have passed mode_t (0, 044, 0644, or such), which might lead future people to copy this broken idiom, and perhaps even believe this parameter has some meaning or implication or application. Delete them all. This comes out of a conversation where tb@ noticed that a strange (but intentional) pledge behaviour is to always knock-out high-bits from mode_t on a number of system calls as a safety factor, and his bewilderment that this appeared to be happening against valid modes (at least visually), but no sorry, they are all irrelevant junk.  They could all be 0xdeafbeef. ok millert

* Merge branch 'obsd-master' into master

* There are many format variables now so allocating all the default ones each time a tree is created is too expensive. Instead, convert them all into callbacks and put them in a static table so they only allocate on demand. The tree remains for the moment for extra (non-default) variables added by for example copy mode or popups. Also reduce expensive calls to localtime_r/strftime. GitHub issue 2253.

* Move the call to setupterm() into the client and have it pass the results to the server over imsg, means the server does not need to enter ncurses or read terminfo db. Old clients will not work with a new server.

* Log missing keys when extended keys is on rather than fatal().

* In the end UTF-8 did not become a terminal feature, should not be listed in man page.

* Send Unicode directional isolate characters around horizontal pane borders if the terminal support UTF-8 and an extension terminfo(5) capability "Bidi" is present. On terminals with BiDi support (ie, VTE) this seems to be enough to display right-to-left text acceptably enough to be usable (with some caveats about the mouse position). Requested by and with help from Mahmoud Elagdar in GitHub issue 2425.

* Add a -S flag to new-window to make it select the existing window if one with the given name already exists rather than failing with an error. Also add a format to check if a window or session name exists which allows the same with other commands. Requested by and discussed with kn@.

* Add -Wno-format-y2k.

* Hide some warnings on newer GCC versions, GitHUb issue 2525.

* Use bitshifts instead of a union for encoding UTF-8 into 32 bits, which is more friendly to GCC3.

* Add to CHANGES.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Change how panes are resized so that the code is clearer and if the pane is resized multiple times during one event loop, it is forced to resize at the end. Also don't zoom/unzoom in switch-client if the pane hasn't changed. GitHub issue 2260.

* Now that we mostly only search visible text, the rate limit on repeating search does not seem to be necessary, remove it for the moment.

* Add support for pausing a pane when the output buffered for a control mode client gets too far behind. The pause-after flag with a time is set on the pane with refresh-client -f and a paused pane may be resumed with refresh-client -A. GitHub issue 2217.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Reset wrapped flag when clearing or moving lines, GitHub issue 2215.

* Search marks outside the visible text are not useful, so there is no point in allocating a big buffer to store them - just allocate the visible text size, and ignore any outside.

* Some improvements to performance of searching:

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* A } can go on the same line as a command.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Update CHANGES.

* Shorten some long lines.

* Correct respawn-* - they don't always use the creation command.

* Make the -no-clear command variants not clear the search marks either.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Allow strings to span multiple lines - newlines and any leading whitespace are removed, as well as any following comments that couldn't be part of a format. This allows long formats or other strings to be annotated and indented.

* Instead of using a custom parse function to process {}, treat it as a set of statements and parse with yacc, then convert back to a string as the last step. This means the rules are consistent inside and outside {}, %if and friends work at the right time, and the final result isn't littered with unnecessary newlines.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Instead of sending all data to control mode clients as fast as possible, add a limit of how much data will be sent to the client and try to use it for panes with some degree of fairness. GitHub issue 2217, with George Nachman.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Remove bad merge.

* Put the fix back for wcwidth() failing.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Set IUTF8 again when it exists.

* Fix some error strings, from Kris Katterjohn.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Make some data types consistent.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Do not attempt to divide by zero when working out copy position.

* Include title for the width of the menu.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Instead of storing all UTF-8 characters in the extended cell which means that 14 bytes are wasted for each character in the BMP, only store characters of three bytes or less in the cell itself and store others (outside the BMP or with combining characters) in a separate global tree. Can reduce grid memory use for heavy Unicode users by around 30%.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Remove leftover call to control_free_offsets and do not use for non-control clients.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Give control code its own state struct.

* Now the tty has a pointer back to the client there is no point (and a bit confusing) in it keeping a copy of the fd as well. Remove it.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Put headers back how they were.

* Maybe this is better.

* Think Solaris needs term.h here.

* And tweak again.

* Fix utf8proc version logging.

* Log ncurses and utf8proc versions.

* FocusIn keys can also update the latest client, like normal keys.

* xterm* can have focus too.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Move client offset stuff into control.c since only control clients will need it.

* spawn.c: fix up bad merge

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Support code for control mode flow control: allow clients to have separate offsets (used and acknowleged) into the pane buffers; turn off reading from panes when no clients can accept the data; and add a -A flag to refresh-client to let clients turn receiving a pane on and off.

* Fix a regression test, size is not updated until end of event loop.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Fix a couple more places where the key flags need to be masked off.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Remove a redundant if statement.

* Key strings need to include the cursor and keypad flags now since the output key lookup expects them already set.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add FreeBSD CI, from Jan Beich.

* Some other ctrl keys need to be translated with extended keys on.

* No paths.h.

* remove vis.h: portable doesn't need this

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Move lazy resize from the pane to the window, there is no point in resizing the window unless it is the current window, and if we do and don't resize the pane until later there are problems if the size changes from A to B then back to A.

* On select-window, make this client the latest client for the window.

* Add a terminal feature for enable/disable extended keys (supported by xterm and mintty) and add an option to make tmux send it. Only forward extended keys if the application has requested them, even though we use the CSI u sequence and xterm uses CSI 27 ~ - this is what mintty does as well.

* Separate key flags and modifiers, log key flags, make the "xterm" flag more explicit and fix M- keys with a leading escape.

* Add an option to set the pane border lines style from a choice of single lines (ACS or UTF-8), double or heavy (UTF-8), simple (plain ASCII) or number (the pane numbers). Lines that won't work on a non-UTF-8 terminal are translated back into ACS when they are output.

* Add screen write flags instead of individual bits and fix line length calculation with padding.

* Add a client flag 'active-pane' which stores the active pane in the client and allows it to be changed independently from the real active pane stored in the window. This is can be used with session groups which allow an independent current window (although it would be nice to have a flag for this too and remove session groups). The client active pane is only really useful interactively, many things (hooks, window-style, zooming) still use the window active pane.

* Expand target from client and use it to expand the prompt.

* Move editor stuff to common code in popup.c.

* Add a mark in copy mode. Set with set-mark command (bound to 'X') by default and the mark and cursor position are swapped with 'jump-to-mark' (bound to M-x). The line containing the mark is shown in copy-mode-mark-style with the horizontal position in reverse.

* Add a -D flag to ask tmux not to daemonize, useful both for running a debugger (lldb does not have follow-fork-mode) and for running with a managed supervisor init system. GitHub issue 2190.

* Do not loop forever when search finds an empty match, GitHub issue 2203.

* Fix next-matching-bracket logic, from Chris Barber.

* Add a customize mode where keys and options may be browsed and changed, includes adding a brief description of each option. Bound to "C" by default.

* Support embedded styles in the display-message message, GitHub issue 2206.

* Store and restore cursor position when copy mode is resized, from Anindya Mukherjee.

* Allow a custom time format to be given to the t format modifier.

* Change message log to be per server rather than per client and include every command that is run.

* Add M-+ and M-- to expand and collapse all items in tree mode.

* Change the existing client flags for control mode to apply for any client, use the same mechanism for the read-only flag and add an ignore-size flag.

* Only redraw popup on the client it belongs to.

* Export TERM_PROGRAM and TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION like various other terminals.

* Add formats for after hook command arguments.

* Try to search the entire history first for up to 200 ms so a search count can be shown. If it takes too long, search the visible text only.

* Do not need to work out status line offset, we already have it.

* Use VIS_CSTYLE for paste buffers also.

* Do not hoke into struct window_pane from the tty code and instead set everything up in tty_ctx. Provide a way to initialize the tty_ctx from a callback and use it to let popups draw directly through input_parse in the same way as panes do, rather than forcing a full redraw on every change.

* Rename and tidy some stuff in struct tty_ctx.

* Add -e for new-session to set environment variables.

* Add 'e' key in buffer mode to open the buffer in an editor.

* Use formats for status-style and message-style.

* Complete partial window indexes properly.

* Add -W and -T flags to command-prompt to only complete a window and a target, also complete aliases.

* Copy mode search improvements:

* Improve command prompt completion:

* Drop having a separate type for style options and make them all strings, which allows formats to be expanded. Any styles without a '#{' are still validated when they are set but any with a '#{' are not. Formats are not expanded usefully in many cases yet, that will be changed later.

* Call format_defaults_window for panes as well.

* Use a grid cell not a style for the pane style.

* Instead of forbidding invalid session names, sanitize them like window names.

* Instead of having a default set of terminals in terminal-overrides that get XT added and using that as a marker for xterm(1)-like, assume that if the terminfo(5) entry already has XT or the clear capability starts with CSI then the terminal is VT100-like and it should be safe to send DA requests. The DA responses trigger additional features being added.

* Do not redraw or update mode if nothing has changed.

* Add feature and capabilities for focus reporting. Also document AX and XT even though they aren't tmux's, and add some bits for rxvt.

* Move terminal features into a single file.

* Build list of paths and weed out duplicates before loading configs, and add TMUX_SOCK like TMUX_PATH for the socket directory.

* Add extension terminfo(5) capabilities for margins.

* Response is iTerm2 not not ITerm2.

* Remove support for iTerm2's DSR 1337 extension and use the CSI > q extension now supported by a few different terminals.

* Add an attribute for ACS.

* Tweak the default choose modes formats:

* Move lazy resize from the pane to the window, there is no point in resizing the window unless it is the current window, and if we do and don't resize the pane until later there are problems if the size changes from A to B then back to A.

* If the application has not requested extended keys, then C-1 sends 1 not nothing.

* Need to update features after all the sequences come in.

* On select-window, make this client the latest client for the window.

* List needs to be sorted.

* XTerm not xterm.

* Er, misread this and it is not needed.

* Translate special CSI u keys on input.

* Get == and != the right way round.

* Only send XDA on 0.

* Fix default values for new escape sequences.

* Only forward extended keys if the application has requested them, even though we use the CSI u sequence and xterm uses CSI 27 ~ - this is what mintty does as well.

* Mask off flags bits in menu keys.

* Add a terminal feature for enable/disable extended keys (supported by xterm and mintty) and add an option to make tmux send it.

* C-M-S keys need the implied flag also.

* Stop at end of buffer.

* Send conventional \033 sequences for keys with just Meta even if they came in as an extended CSI u key sequence. It is much more useful for applications that don't understand CSI u to receive \033> for M-S-. rather than \033[62;3u.

* Send CSI u sequences for any keys that do not have a defined sequence already - this should only be similar sequences sent by the terminal outside tmux if enabled.

* Separate key flags and modifiers, log key flags, make the "xterm" flag more explicit and fix M- keys with a leading escape.

* Rename KEYC_ESCAPE to KEYC_META.

* Always set xterm flag.

* Recognise extended key sequences on input (both the forms xterm offers).

* xterm-keys has been on by default for 5 years and all other modern terminals use these key sequences by default. Merge the code into the main tty and input tree processing (convering the latter to use a tree rather than a table at the same time) and make the option a no-op.

* Draw outside correctly with pane numbers.

* Check if outside the window before checking if on the border so that cells that are outside in one direction but not the other are not given the wrong type.

* Add an option to set the pane border lines style from a choice of single lines (ACS or UTF-8), double or heavy (UTF-8), simple (plain ASCII) or number (the pane numbers). Lines that won't work on a non-UTF-8 terminal are translated back into ACS when they are output.

* Tweak CHANGES.

* Update CHANGES.

* Add screen write flags instead of individual bits and fix line length calculation with padding.

* Add a client flag 'active-pane' which stores the active pane in the client and allows it to be changed independently from the real active pane stored in the window. This is can be used with session groups which allow an independent current window (although it would be nice to have a flag for this too and remove session groups). The client active pane is only really useful interactively, many things (hooks, window-style, zooming) still use the window active pane.

* Expand target from client and use it to expand the prompt.

* Use safe loop for freeing client files.

* Add -Z to customize-mode binding.

* Tidy up border redrawing, fix some errors in how the window border connects with panes.

* Move editor stuff to common code in popup.c.

* Add a mark in copy mode. Set with set-mark command (bound to 'X') by default and the mark and cursor position are swapped with 'jump-to-mark' (bound to M-x). The line containing the mark is shown in copy-mode-mark-style with the horizontal position in reverse.

* Initialize return code in case something mysterious happens.

* Wrap all lines in customize mode, not just the description.

* Remove unused variables.

* Fix some warnings, from Jan Polensky.

* Fix some customize mode drawing nits.

* Add a customize mode where options may be browsed and changed, includes adding a brief description of each option. Bound to "C" by default.

* imsg.h needs uio.h, pointed out by deraadt

* Allow a custom time format to be given to the t format modifier.

* Fix pretty time function to actually work and allow time format to be applied to any string that is suitable.

* Update CHANGES.

* Change message log to be per server rather than per client and include every command that is run.

* Turn off cursor in menus again.

* Merge branch '3.1b-rc'

* Add to CHANGES.

* Try to search the entire history first for up to 200 ms so a search count can be shown. If it takes too long, search the visible text only.

* Use the cursor position not the current position when working out which marks are current.

* Need musl-gcc for static also.

* Add musl builds.

* Ugh, enable not with.

* Use termcap instead.

* Try w/o database.

* Add build of everything.

* Add more stuff.

* Fix exclude.

* Add static build.

* Merge branch '3.1b-rc'

* Portable does not need sys/queue.h.

* Do not need to work out status line offset, we already have it.

* Clamping to area needs to use the offset without the status line, since that is where the window offsets are based.

* menu_mode_cb needs to return a screen also.

* Update CHANGES.

* Use VIS_CSTYLE for paste buffers also.

* Turn off overlay check when we know we are inside.

* Get the whole overlay screen not just the mode so cursor changes are included.

* Do not hoke into struct window_pane from the tty code and instead set everything up in tty_ctx. Provide a way to initialize the tty_ctx from a callback and use it to let popups draw directly through input_parse in the same way as panes do, rather than forcing a full redraw on every change.

* Rename tty_pane_full_width to tty_full_width.

* Move size to tty_ctx.

* Rename some tty_ctx members.

* Add -e for new-session.

* Solaris at least does not have _PATH_VI.

* Typo in man page.

* Add 'e' key in buffer mode to open the buffer in an editor.

* Start with style initialized to default.

* Drop having a separate type for style options and make them all strings, which allows formats to be expanded. Any styles without a '#{' are still validated when they are set but any with a '#{' are not. Formats are not expanded usefully in many cases yet, that will be changed later.

* Call format_defaults_window for panes as well.

* Always start sync for output in panes that are not the active pane.

* Apply terminal-overrides after terminal detection, it always takes precedence.

* Change how sync works to always send the end sequence after all output is done when we are returning to the event loop (since we always move the cursor at that point). Also a man fix from jmc.

* Change the Sync capability to be a string instead of a flag.

* Tidy up the terminal detection and feature code and add named sets of terminal features, each of which are defined in one place and map to a builtin set of terminfo(5) capabilities. Features can be specified based on TERM with a new terminal-features option or with the -T flag when running tmux. tmux will also detect a few common terminals from the DA and DSR responses.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Also redraw panes which aren't pane 0. Problem reported by tb@.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Only trim blank lines when the source pane is not the target pane, otherwise the cursor moves which is a bit strange.

* Need to check for pane redrawing even if just the window flag is set (the pane flag may not have been previously set to avoid looping the windows).

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* The PANE_REDRAW flag bit might be needed by other panes so we can't clear it on the first redraw, and it can't be set when we are finished or they would be redrawn again, so if the redraw is deferred for a client, copy the redraw flag into a separate set of bits just for that client.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Reset background colour on scrolled line.

* There is no point in keeping a bunch of different text buffers for each line when writing, we only need one as big as the line width - there can't be any more text than that since newer will overwrite older.

* Bring back previons fix to only redraw panes that need it after a redraw is deferred, but clear the pane flags when they are actually redrawn rather than every time.

* Add formats for pane written/skipped bytes for debugging.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Only update mode when actually going to redraw something.

* Add a flag to protect against nested syncs and add some extra logging to redrawing.

* Revert previous, there is still a problem.

* When a redraw is deferred because the terminal hasn't finished reading the data from the last one, other panes could update while waiting, so we set the flag to redraw them all when the new redraw actually happened. But this means a lot of redrawing panes unnecessarily if they haven't changed - so instead set a flag to say "at least one pane needs to be redrawed" then look at the invidual pane flags to see which ones need it.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Set mode properly before and after redrawing, and don't bother calculating cursor position if it won't be used.

* Do not move the cursor to the existing y position if it is invalid, go home instead.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* There is no point allocating a new item and putting it on the list when the whole line is cleared line, there is never any point in doing it more than once. Instead store the background colour alone.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Make sure the cursor position is still on screen after we have trimmed empty lines. Also improve some log messages.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Support the application escape sequence mintty (means tmux doesn't have to delay to wait for Escape).

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Missed a few warnings in previous.

* Make client -c and -t handling common in cmd-queue.c and try to be clearer about whether the client is the target client (must have a session) or not.

* Add helpers for the simple case of parse string and add to command queue.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* When parsing strings, put all commands in one group even if there are newlines. This means that for example bind q { a \n b } and bind q "a ; b" are the same. Also log commands in different groups separated by ;; rather than ; (a command list like this should never be user visible).

* When adding a list of commands to the queue, instead of automatically creating a new state for each group of commands, require the caller to create one and use it for all the commands in the list. This means the current target works even with list with multiple groups (which can happen if they are defined with newlines).

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Move cmdq_state into cmd-queue.c.

* Rename cmdq_shared to cmdq_state which will better reflect what it is (going to be) used for.

* Store a key event not a mouse event in the shared data.

* Move the NOHOOKS flag into the shared flags.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Also move cmdq_item and cmdq_list into cmd-queue.c (this is to make its use more clearly defined and preparation for some future work).

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Make struct cmd local to cmd.c and move it out of tmux.h.

* Change so that the appropriate hooks for windows and panes belong to pane/window options rather than all being session options. This is useful for example to create a pane that is automatically closed on some condition. From Anindya Mukherjee.

* Print empty arguments properly.

* Mention RGB, pointed out by Jody Frankowski.

* Add a -f filter argument to the list commands like choose-tree.

* Add a -f filter argument to the list commands like choose-tree.

* Clarify a couple of style options.

* Remove unused define, also a man fix from jmc.

* Now that copy mode copies the pane content rather than keeping a reference to it, it isn't necessary that the pane in copy mode is the same as the one copying from. Add a -s flag to copy-mode to specify a different pane for the source content. This means it is possible to view two places in a pane's history at the same time in different panes, or copy from a pane's history into an editor or shell in the same pane.

* More style nits.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Fix history-bottom to use the right line when working out the length.

* Pass correct flags to fnmatch.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Wait until the initial command sequence is done before sending a device attributes request and other bits that prompt a reply from the terminal. This means that stray relies are not left on the terminal if the command has attached and then immediately detached and tmux will not be around to receive them. Prompted by a problem report from espie@.

* Mention paste at same place as copy, suggested by John Boyle.

* Restore pane_current_path format from portable tmux, it is no longer used by default and is very useful.

* Change source-file to use new file code which allows it to read from stdin.

* Do not check if client is dead if it is NULL.

* Rewrite the code for reading and writing files. Now, if the client is not attached, the server process asks it to open the file, similar to how works for stdin, stdout, stderr. This makes special files like /dev/fd/X work (used by some shells). stdin, stdout and stderr and control mode are now just special cases of the same mechanism. This will also make it easier to use for other commands that read files such as source-file.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Allow search across wrapped lines and fix some inconsistencies in how th position is represented, GitHub issue 2014 from Anindya Mukherjee.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add default # and * binding with vi(1) keys.

* Fixes to CHANGES.

* 3.0 version.

* Some old tmux versions can sometimes generate layout strings which have the incorrect size for the top cell. Previously tmux didn't care but now that panes can be partly hidden, the size matters and is checked more strictly. So add some code to fix up the most common problem and a sanity check to reject layouts with any other size problems. Reported by Aleksandrs Ledovskis in GitHub issue 1930.

* CUB and CUF are also limited by the margins so use CUP instead when margins are enabled (we already do this for linefeed).

* Add an option to set the key sent by backspace for those whose system uses ^H rather than ^?. GitHub issue 1969.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add -F flag to send-keys to expand formats in search-backward and forward copy mode commands, this makes it easier to use the cursor_word and cursor_line formats. From Anindya Mukherjee in GitHub issue 1964.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Limit lazy resize to panes in attached sessions only - those in unattached are likely to have been resized by something like split-window where the user probably wants the resize to happen immediately. GitHub issue 1963.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* asprintf returns -1, not an arbitrary value < 0.  Also upon error the (very sloppy specification) leaves an undefined value in *ret, so it is wrong to inspect it, the error condition is enough. discussed a little with nicm, and then much more with millert until we were exasperated

* Pass target on to new commands with if -F.

* Do not always resize the window back to its original size after applying a layout, let the normal window resize process do it. This means windows are not resized at all if window-size is manual, and are not resized multiple times if later attached to a different size terminal.

* Need to adjust for lines if at top.

* Use the y offset from the context which has already been adjusted for the status line, also make tty_clamp_line adjust the y position.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

Originally it was only intended as the target client where the message should be displayed but at some point (perhaps when -p was added), it was used for format expansion too.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* For some reason tmux treats SGR 10 as SGR 0. It has done since the first version and I'm not sure why since no other terminal appears to. Change to just ignore SGR 10 instead.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Update CHANGES.

* Support ISO colon-separated SGR.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Reflowing the grid in-place involved way too much memmove() for a big performance cost with a large history. Instead change back to using a second grid and copying modified lines over which is much faster (this doesn't revert to the old code however which didn't support UTF-8 properly). GitHub issue 1249.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add struct status_line to hold status line members of struct client, not used yet but will be soon. From Thomas Adam.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add to CHANGES.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Do not need to set up USR2 twice.

* Block signals between forking and clearing signal handlers (or calling event_reinit) - if the child gets a signal and fires the libevent signal handler during this period it could write a signal into the parent's signal pipe. GitHub issue 1001 from Aaron van Geffen.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Extend filters (f key) to buffer and client mode and add -f flag to specify to command.

* Add -O option to choose-* to set initial sort order.

* Default sort for buffer mode should be time not name.

* Typo.

* Remove a bunch of out-of-date stuff from the FAQ or stuff that is documentation for other programs.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Continue and pass keys through if they are repeated keys, so that the first key after a repeated key doesn't get lost.

* Do not pass a state into commands when fired on individual items in tree mode, rely on the %% target substitution in the command for the chosen pane and leave the default target as the current pane (where the mode is). Otherwise, joinp and similar end up with -t and -s the same. Reported by Jacob Niehus in GitHub issue 960.

* Delete input event when evbuffer_read() fails to avoid just spinning around a dead file descriptor. Seems to fix a problem reported by Greg Hurrell in GitHub issue 941.

* Do not leak command, from David CARLIER.

* tparm() fix for Solaris.

* signal.h for utempter, from David CARLIER.

* Add a timeout to prevent the sequences which wait for a specific terminator (OSC, APC and DCS) waiting forever, which helps to avoid garbage (cat /dev/random) locking up panes completely. This (and the last commit) prompted by a discussion with theo.

* Remove unused variable.

* Be more strict about escape sequences that rename windows or set titles: ignore any that not valid UTF-8 outright, and for good measure pass the result through our UTF-8-aware vis(3).

* Support SIGUSR2 to stop and start logging for an existing server. Also we currently only have two log levels so just use -v and -vv rather than -v and -vvvv, and clarify the man page entry for -v.

* time.h here too.

* Need time.h.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Some changes that will appear when we sync up.

* Some applications like vi(1) and tmux until 10 minutes or so ago, do not redraw on SIGWINCH if the size returns to the original size between the original SIGWINCH and when they get around to calling TIOCGWINSZ. So use the existing resize timer to introduce a small delay between the two resizes.

* It is not OK to ignore SIGWINCH if SIOCGWINSZ reports the size has unchanged, because it may have changed and changed back in the time between us getting the signal and calling ioctl(). Always redraw when we see SIGWINCH.

* Because we defer actually resizing applications (calling TIOCSWINSZ) until the end of the server loop, tmux may have gone through several internal resizes in between. This can be a problem if the final size is the same as the initial size (what the application things it currently is), because the application may choose not to redraw, assuming the screen state is unchanged, when in fact tmux has thrown away parts of the screen, assuming the application will redraw them.

* Look for setrgbf and setrgbb terminfo extensions for RGB colour. This is the most reasonable of the various (some bizarre) suggestions for capabilities.

* Rewrite of choose mode, both to simplify and tidy the code and to add some modern features.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Preserve search string when entering prompt again.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add m: for fnmatch(3) format matching.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Do not factor in screen_hsize() for the visible copy mode screen when adjusting the selection, it should never have any useful history (and when it does, after resize, we shouldn't use it). From Michal Mazurek.

* Tweak text to mention initial size, from John Hood.

* Update release text.

* Merge branch '2.5-rc'

* 2.5.

* Add to CHANGES.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Support OSC 10 and 11 to set foreground and background colours, from "bertnp" in GitHub issue 942.

* Changes in master.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Change so that sessions created detached (-d or no client) are always 80x24 and the status line is not applied until they attach. Also make -x and -y work for control clients whether the session is detached or not.

* Add test for -x and -y too.

* Also recalculate session sizes when refreh-client -C is used. GitHub issue 947.

* Do not need /dev/null.

* Add some tests.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Check the terminfo(5) U8 capability and disable using UTF-8 for ACS if it is present and zero. This is useful for users with terminals or fonts that do not correctly support UTF-8 line drawing characters. GitHub issue 927, reported by Hiroaki Yamazoe and Akinori Hattori.

* Notify layout changed when choosing predefined layouts, from Joshua Brot.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* The Konsole SU bug means it can't clear the entire scroll region (it ignores if >= size, not if > as I first thought). So we can't effectively fix it in code - remove the workarounds which just cause bugs on other terminals.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Scroll the right number of lines off the region when clearing.

* Some other unused variables.

* Merge branch '2.5-rc'

* 2.5-rc2.

* Reset updated flag when restarting job so new output is detected, reported by Gregory Pakosz in GitHub issue 922.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Compare >= for columns not >.

* Can scroll away full lines to clear them too.

* Remove an unused variable.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch '2.5-rc'

* When expanding a line in order to clear it, we need to use the default background colour - there may be portions that we do not want to clear with the new background colour.

* ECH needs to use background colour.

* Need to clear tty context before using it.

* Cannot rely on cursor position after DL and IL (some terminals move to column 0, some do not).

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Need to store bg for ECH.

* Cannot rely on cursor position after DL and IL (some terminals move to column 0, some do not).

* Need to clear tty context before using it.

* Only redraw single client, and tweak some logging.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Scrolling needs to use background colour.

* Regions can't be smaller than 2 so don't try to clear them by scrolling if so.

* Can use INDN to clear regions with default background colour if margins are supported.

* ECH needs to use background colour.

* Store copy mode search string in pane so search-again command works even if you exit and reenter copy mode (it doesn't remember the position, just the search string), suggested by espie@.

* Merge branch '2.5-rc'

* Clear to start of screen needs to use background colour.

* Need to redraw out to cellsize (total cells used in a line) rather than cellused (only non-space cells) because there may be cells with a nondefault background.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Clear to start of screen needs to use background colour.

* Need to redraw out to cellsize (total cells used in a line) rather than cellused (only non-space cells) because there may be cells with a nondefault background.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Make environ_log prefix take a format.

* Change how we resolve which pane is dragging when there are multiple options - choose the largest pane, which is more likely to be the one the user wants to resize. Prompted by a report from Thomas Sattler.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Move to the right cursor position before using spaces to clear.

* Prevent control clients from affecting the session size until they have specified a size with refresh-client -C. Prompted by a different change with the same purpose from George Nachman.

* We can use ECH to clear sections of lines, so use it for internal panes (that don't touch an edge). Move all the tty clear code into two common functions rather than having the same bunch of checks everywhere.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Expand formats in option names and add -F flag to do so in option values as well.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Insert copy mode bindings at the right place in the command queue.

* Typo.

* Back to master.

* Fix test.

* 2.5-rc and changes.

* Merge branch 'master' of github.com:tmux/tmux

* Update TODO.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* If the target pane for send-keys in in a mode with a key table (that is, copy mode), then look the key up in the table and fire any command instead of delivering the key to the pane directly where it will be ignored. This makes C-b C-b (send-prefix) work in copy mode again.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* If the current screen was complex enough, it was possible to make redraw itself hit the "terminal can't keep up" check. To avoid this, record how much data we send during redraw (we know we will be starting with 0) and skip the check until it has been flushed. GitHub issue 912.

* Set current pane in rotate-window.

* Add a format for the name of the pane's mode, lets it be used as a conditional for key bindings.

* Up to now, tmux sees \033\033[OA as M-Up and since we turned on xterm-keys by default, generates \033[1;3A instead of \033\033[OA. Unfortunately this confuses vi, which doesn't understand xterm keys and now sees Escape+Up pressed within escape-time as Escape followed by A.

* Add some formats to look at the session window stack, suggested by Scott ROCHFORD.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Some new notifications, mainly for active pane and current window and session:

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add a format for the last search string in copy mode and fix the prompt so it can work when in -I, suggested by Suraj N Kurapati.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* In order that people can use formats like #D in #() in the status line and not have to wait for an update when they change pane, we allow commands to run more than once a second if the expanded form changes. Unfortunately this can mean them being run far too often (pretty much continually) when multiple clients exist, because some formats (including #D) will always differ between clients.

* .NOTPARALLEL.

* Add regress/Makefile.

* Make example match reality; Greg Hurrell.

* Add to TODO.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Fix UTF-8 combining characters in column 0, based on a diff from Keith Winstein.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch 'master' of github.com:tmux/tmux

* Test that kill-session closes the panes (processes end up dead).

* Log what is happening with window and session reference counts much more obviously.

* Remove a reference from the right window when removing from a winlink's list.

* Do not put the window on the alerts queue and add a reference unless the alert is enabled and we are actually going to add the alerts event.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Konsole incorrectly ignores SU (CSI S) if the parameter is bigger than the scroll region, so clamp it. Reported by Moritz Bunkus.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Default for xterm-keys was wrong, stop documenting it.

* source-file too.

* Tests for some new session and new window bits.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Make full width panes try to play more nicely with terminal copy and paste by avoiding explicit line wraps if we think the terminal will wrap anyway.

* When we write out the grid including escape sequences, an SGR 0 needs to cause the colours to be written again. Also treat colours separately from attributes so that RGB colours will work.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Do not update TERM into config file parsing has finished.

* Block the initial client if there is one until the configuration file has finished loading.

* Another test.

* Remove stuff from TODO.

* And another test.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* And another.

* Try to start writing test scripts.

* if-shell doesn't need to queue its error message into a callback, and in fact it can't do so because the item it was working with will have been freed. Reported by Daniel Hahler.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Only use ED for clear screen if at the bottom, same as earlier fix to clear end of screen.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Memory leak from David CARLIER.

* Do not need getopt.h.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Can't collect UTF-8 characters of more than one byte at the moment.

* new -A should use the session name.

* Get rid of the extra layer of flags and cmd_prepare() and just store the CMD_FIND_* flags in the cmd_entry and call it for the command. Commands with special requirements call it themselves and update the target for hooks to use.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Mouse bindings and hooks set up an initial current state when running a command. This is used for the session, window and pane for all commands in the command sequence if there is no -t or -s.

* We need to collect UTF-8 characters so that width != 1 characters are correctly flushed.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Fix if-shell without a client (so in the config file). Reported by Theo Buehler.

* Typo in example.

* Memory leaks, from David CARLIER.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Log error properly when no current state, and some other minor tweaks.

* Make sure cmd_find_from_* clear the state if they fail.

* Rename a variable.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Clear shared state if not filling it in.

* Make the cmd_find_* functions more obvious when looking for a client, rather than having it inside other functions. Should be no change to the way targets are resolved just yet.

* Key needs to be initialized to zero now it has flags in it.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Style nits and an unused struct.

* Add cmd_find_from_winlink_pane and use it in a couple of places, and make functions that can't fail void.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* It is annoying that the copy mode key table (or any other key table) will suppress root key table bindings. So change to always check the root table if no binding is found in the current table (whether it be the prefix table from pressing the prefix or the copy mode table from a pane).

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* More unnecessary arguments now winlink points back to session.

* History needs to be loaded after config parsing is done - now that commands are queued, that's in cfg_done not after start_cfg finishes.

* Store state shared between multiple commands in the queue in a shared structure.

* Do not run the config file in the context of the first client, instead use no client like we did before. This means commands like new-session won't try to attach if they are in the config file.

* Fix after merge

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Typo; Daniel Hahler.

* Do not need getopt.h for getopt, from Eric N Vander Weele.

* Merge branch 'master' of github.com:tmux/tmux

* getptmfd() and fdforkpty() compat.

* Use fdforkpty() instead of our own unwrapped versions.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Only set up a current target for mouse key bindings. Fixes:

* Notes on target resolution.

* Turn on debug if $VERSION is master rather than commenting and uncommenting.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge tag '2.4'

* Enter date of release.

* Missing :.

* Changes to CHANGES.

* Now that struct winlink has a session pointer, can remove some arguments.

* Update CHANGES file

* There is no real need for window_printable_flags to allocate, make it return a buffer from the stack.

* Update TODO.

* If a #() command doesn't exit, use its most recent line of output (it must be a full line). Don't let it redraw the status line more than once a second.

* Add to TODO.

* load_cfg returns < 0 on error, not != 0. Problem reported by Kaushal Modi.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* load_cfg returns < 0 on error, not != 0. Problem reported by Kaushal Modi.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add a suspend helper function, and do not allow detaching or suspending while already doing so.

* Version 2.4.

* Missed freezero.

* Style nits and a missing cast.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Missed freezero.

* When the data we have buffered to write to a terminal grows beyond a reasonable amount (currently width * height * 8 bytes), discard all output to the terminal and start trying to redraw periodically instead. Continue with this until the amount of data we are trying to write falls to a low level again.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Revert use of DECSLRM on iTerm2, it doesn't help as much as we throught, and there are some question marks about it's support.

* On terminals without DECSLRM, when a pane that is less than the full with of the terminal scrolls, tmux needs to redraw the entire pane. This results in a large amount of output data which can cause slow terminals to struggle, particularly when many lines are scrolled together quickly.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Detect iTerm2 and use DECSLRM for it as well.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add a format for number of bytes writtent to client, useful for debugging.

* Do not check for BCE for a background colour that isn't needed, use colour 8 instead.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Include client name in key logging.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Don't bother moving the cursor for empty lines.

* Remove a couple of redraw flags that no longer have any effect.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Memory leak, from David CARLIER.

* Use EL1 to clear lines when redrawing the leftmost pane, rather than spaces.

* Accept NULL pointer.

* Update imsg*.c from OpenBSD.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add Home and End for copy mode.

* Try again to resolve problems with mistaking sessions for windows: now do not look up windows as sessions (and panes as windows) when they are qualified with a ':' or a '.'. So 'foo' as a window target will look for windows and sessions called 'foo', but ':foo' will only look for windows, and 'foo:' only for sessions. This means the common case of using an unadorned session as a window target (send -tfoo) should continue to work, but an explicit window will not get confused with a session (send -t:foo).

* Give each client a name. This defaults to the tty name as before but falls back to an alternative if the tty name is not available. This is clearer than overloading the client ttyname member and allows us to remove the path stored in the tty struct, it should always be the same as the client.

* cfg_file can be static.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Write raw strings in one go rather than character at a time.

* Merge branch 'master' of github.com:tmux/tmux

* Update imsg*.[ch] from OpenBSD, add some compat bits it needs and remove some bits it doesn't.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Bump automake and autoconf versions.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* DEFS -> AM_CPPFLAGS.

* Should not need -D_POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS.

* Use AC_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS and explicitly check for daemon() in headers.

* Add support for the strikethrough attribute (SGR 9), using the new smxx terminfo capability. This means there are now nine attribute bits, so anything above 0xff uses an extended cell.

* Merge branch 'master' of github.com:tmux/tmux

* Add to TODO.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Do not test for term.h since we don't use the result.

* Use uid_t for UID not u_int.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Redraw after killp -a.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Invalidate the cursor when we think we should have wrapped.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Try to avoid moving the cursor to the start of the next line when printing cells if it is already at the very end of the line and the terminal will wrap it to the next line itself, this means terminals still see it as a wrapped line for the purposes of their own mouse selection. Reported by millert@.

* Revert previous, breaks normal short targets, reported by Theo Buehler.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Change to vim(1) script by Eric Pruitt.

* If splitw -b is used, insert the new pane before the current one in the pane list. This means the numbering is in order (for example for display-panes) and fixes a problem with redrawing the active pane borders.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Minor bits: fix an array size, add comment, make grid_cell_entry static.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Change pane redraw to collect cells up as well, and simplify it a bit.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Don't need is1,is2,is3 so remove them.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Scrolling at least needs to be flushed before sending EL to the terminal (but it is simpler to flush everything, so do that instead).

* Reflect OBSD Makefile changes in Makefile.am

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Improve NetBSD KERN_PROC2 bit, mostly from Kamil Rytarowski.

* Add SGR 28 to clear hidden flag.

* Add to TODO.

* Handle insert cells when cursor at edge of screen correctly, and do a full flush before insert.

* Merge clear-history into capture-pane.

* Remove vis.h.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Make source-file look for files relative to the client working directory (like load-buffer and save-buffer), from Chris Pickel. Also break the where-is-this-file code out into its own function for loadb and saveb.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Collected cells may still need to be extended for RGB colours.

* Add not delete the event if more to write.

* Don't use a bufferevent for the tty, so we can keep better track of what is being written and when.

* Instead of numbering session groups, give them a name which may be given to -t instead of a target session. Also allow them to contain only one session.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Another helper function to write to terminal and log.

* Do not adjust region lower by pane offset when scrolling up, it is already an absolute position.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* window_copy_pagedown shouldn't reset the mode anymore, instead let the caller do it so it can free the marks. Problem reported by attila at stalphonsos dot com.

* Add support for scroll up escape sequence (CSI S) and use it when possible instead of sending individual line feeds.

* Collect sequences of printable ASCII characters and process them together instead of handling them one by one. This is significantly faster. Sequences are terminated when we reach the end of the line, fill the internal buffer, or a different character is seen by the input parser (an escape sequence, or UTF-8).

* Fix clear start of line.

* DECSLRM in xterm(1) appears to have a quirk where it can generate an extra scroll of the entire terminal; issuing DECSTBM first prevents this. Do that for now.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Unfortunately DECFRA does not handle default colours properly (it does not reset colours when in SGR 0), so we can't use it without more trouble than it is worth. Abandon the idea for now.

* Merge branch 'master' of github.com:tmux/tmux

* Look for libtinfo before libncurses.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Use DECFRA on VT420 compatible terminals (so, xterm) and ED on all others for clearing panes.

* Cache status line position to reduce option lookups during output.

* Expand lines more aggressively to reduce rate of allocations.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add a window or pane id "tag" to each format tree and use it to separate jobs, this means that if the same job is used for different windows or panes (for example in pane-border-format), it will be run separately for each pane.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Implement "all event" (1003) mouse mode but in a way that works. The main issue is that if we have two panes, A with 1002 and B with 1003, we need to set 1003 outside tmux in order to get all the mouse events, but then we need to suppress the ones that pane A doesn't want. This is easy in SGR mouse mode, because buttons == 3 is only used for movement events (for other events the trailing m/M marks a release instead), but in normal mouse mode we can't tell so easily. So for that, look at the previous event instead - if it is drag+release as well, then the current event is a movement event.

* Convert terminal-overrides to an array option.

* Remove some lies about terminal-overrides from tmux.1.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* server-info can become an alias rather than a command.

* Add support for custom command aliases, this is an array option which contains items of the form "alias=command". This is consulted when an unknown command is parsed.

* If given an array option without an index either show or set all items, and support -a for array options. Allow the separator for set to be specified in the options table (will be used for backwards compatibility later).

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* pty.c needs compat.h.

* Shorten a long line, and don't leak buffer in paste_add if size is zero.

* Define away pledge() on !OpenBSD.

* Look for ncursesw as well as ncurses, based on a change from Bert van Hall.

* Put version in log in portable tmux.

* If --enable-{utf8proc,utempter} is given, do not build without it.

* vis.h comes from compat.h.

* getopt() has a struct option so just return to using options_entry.

* Remove vis.h which comes from compat.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* It is silly for cmd_list_parse to return an integer error when it could just return NULL.

* -q flag now needs to be checked in a couple more places.

* Major tidy up and rework of options tree and set-option/show-options commands this pushes more of the code into options.c and ties it more closely to the options table rather than having an unnecessary split. Also add support for array options (will be used later). Only (intentional) user visible change is that show-options output is now passed through vis(3) with VIS_DQ so quotes are escaped.

* Remove unused quiet option.

* Append needs to go old,new not new,old...

* Simplify appending to string options.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Put all palette functions together in the file.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* aixterm colours can be used if -2 is given, as well as if TERM tells us the terminal has >=16 colours.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* avoid unneccessary markup; tweaked and ok nicm

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add a format for the version.

* Add %if/%endif for conditionals when parsing configuration files, the argument is a format (the new == and != are useful).

* Add simple comparisons in formats: #{==:a,b} and #{!=:a,b} ("a" and "b" are expanded so can compare formats). And expand the condition to #{?a,b,c} (the "a" part) if it doesn't work as a simple lookup.

* Add support for the OSC 4 and OSC 104 palette setting escape sequences, from S Gilles.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Nits found with clang.

* Incremental search in copy mode (on for emacs keys by default) - much the same as normal searching but updates the cursor position and marked search terms as you type. C-r and C-s in the prompt repeat the search, once finished searching (with Enter), N and n work as before.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Highlight all occurrences of search string after searching in copy mode.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Escape backspace for capture-pane -P, from George Nachman.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Only skip moving the cursor if it is already in the last position _on the same line_, fixes redraw bug reported by patrick keshishian.

* Make prefix work in all tables (except the prefix table). Users who want to avoid this can set prefix to "none" and bind send-prefix themselves. Allows C-b t be bound in the copy mode tables again, pointed out by millert@.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Fix check for cursor at end of line.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Make send -N work for all keys, not just in copy mode. From Artem Fokin.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* When comparing ocy to orlower in tty_cmd_cell, there is no need to add yoff (because they are both already relative to the pane). Also fix some other minor nits.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* The mouse valid flag needs to be correct before we fire the dragging callback, so move the callback outside of server_client_check_mouse and use a new special key code to indicate it.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* If in the middle of a drag, don't use an invalid key, just use KEYC_MOUSE as a placeholder. Reported by Artem Fokin.

* Fix so that we work out the right pane from mouse events - we were doing so too early, before the mouse event was necessarily valid, so could end up using the pane from the previous mouse event, or the active pane.

* Make the selection able to exist independent of the cursor position, so that it is not affected by scrolling. If MouseDragEnd1Pane is bound to the new "stop-selection" command:

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* For mouse keys, use the mouse pane as the default current pane.

* Error on invalid modifier keys.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Key running commands for #() by the unexpanded command, and run them again if the expanded form changes (otherwise at most once per second as usual). Fixes issues reported by Gregory Pakosz.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Fix calculation of whether we need a region for drawing a cell (only if full width and at the edge of the region), otherwise clear the region entirely.

* Do not stop dragging when the wheel is pressed, from Artem Fokin.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Initialize modeprefix to 1 properly in window_pane_create, from Artem Fokin.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* The target validity check used window_pane_visible but that may be false if the pane is zoomed, so instead add a new function to just check if the pane is actually on screen (most commands still want to accept panes invisible by zoom). Also reject panes outside the window for various special targets. Problem reported by Sean Haugh.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Turn on margins, with a couple of fixes (only limit to the pane for line feeds, and do not move cursor to end for full width panes).

* And of course I just find a bug, disable previous for now.

* Initial attempt to make use of left and right margins if the terminal supports them (that is, if it advertises itself as a VT420 - probably just xterm). These are the vertical equivalent of the scroll region and allow much faster scrolling of panes that do not take up the full width of the terminal.

* Do not crash with run-shell -b and no window pane available, reported by Sergei Dyshel.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Do not try to set the CHANGED flag on windows with no active pane, fixes problem reported by Nelo-T Wallus.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* enum values need to fit in 32 bits; we only use enum for numbering and Unicode characters fit in 24 bits, so we can leave key_code as 64 bits and change KEYC_BASE down to 0x10000000.

* Note about TERM.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Make an empty state on error rather than leaving something partially created (which now is now a fatal() later).

* Do not force symbols to width 1, from Yen Chi Hsuan.

* Merge branch 'master' of github.com:tmux/tmux

* Buffer name can be NULL, check before strdup().

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Do not handle activity or silence alerts in the current window, reported by jasper@.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add %%% to substitute with quotes escaped (convert " to \"). Use this for the prompts in copy mode. Fixes problems with jumping to ' reported by Theo Buehler.

* Put AM_* back, but this time do a dance in configure.ac so that we can keep using CFLAGS for the tests.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Do not have a default binding for C-b in copy-mode-vi or it conflicts with the default prefix. Reported by natano@.

* Alerts are too slow, so rather than walking all sessions and windows, add a link of winlinks to each window and a pointer to the session to each winlink. Also rewrite the alerts processing to return to the old behaviour (alert in any window sets the flag on any winlink).

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Move session-create hook out of session_create so it works with grouped sessions.

* Merge branch 'master' of github.com:tmux/tmux

* Revert the AM_* change, I can't find a way to make AC_CHECK_HEADER use LIBEVENT_CFLAGS.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Clear cell entry with grid_default_entry not grid_default_cell.

* I don't remember why we have make clean in dist-hook; remove it.

* Give each item on queue a name for better logging.

* Zero dirty count after flushing.

* Store the right size in the pipe offset for pipe-pane.

* Can use enable_* rather than adding our own found_* variables, from Dilyan Palauzov.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Use notifys for alerts too.

* Use the notify name string instead of going via an enum and change existing hooks to use notifys instead.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Update TODO.

* Add hook_session and hook_window formats to get information on the affected session or window when a hook fires. Enable session-created and session-closed hooks now that that is available.

* Provide a way for hooks to tag formats onto the commands they fire so that the user can get at additional information - now used for the "hook" format, more to come.

* Notifys can go via the command queue instead of using their own queue.

* Mass rename struct cmd_q to struct cmdq_item and related.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Rewrite command queue handling. Each client still has a command queue, but there is also now a global command queue. Instead of command queues being dispatched on demand from wherever the command happens to be added, they are now all dispatched from the top level server loop. Command queues may now also include callbacks as well as commands, and items may be inserted after the current command as well as at the end.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Only use pane with run-shell if -t is given.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* zap double .Pp;

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Give window_create and window_create1 better names.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Rename a function for consistency and some spacing nits.

* Fire hooks on the simple notifys (window-renamed and session-renamed), the complicated ones get no hooks for now (more to come).

* Drain notifys once at the end of the server loop instead of doing it from the end of every command queue (which could be nested).

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add CMD_AFTERHOOK flag to the easy commands that don't need any special handling.

* Don't make assumptions about line wrap on !xenl terminals, means that using a wrong TERM without xenl is not so broken if used on a sensible terminal.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* source-file and some other commands can recurse back into cmdq_continue, which could potentially free the currently running command, so we need to take a reference to it in cmdq_continue_one.

* Missing flags in capture-pane, and tweak choose-tree text. From Dilyan Palauzov.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Trying to do hooks generically is way too complicated and unreliable and confusing, particularly trying to automatically figure out what target hooks should be using. So simplify it:

* Update TODO.

* Remove the set-remain-on-exit option, it was always a hack and can now be done with hooks instead.

* tmux no longer uses openat() so we can remove the compatibilty function.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add support for BCE (background colour erase). This makes various escape sequences (notable EL and ED but also IL, DL, ICH, DCH) create blank cells using the current background colour rather than the default colour.

* Update TODO.

* Remove mention of key tables than no longer exist.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Some improvements and bug fixes for hooks:

* -f missed from splitw usage, from Felix Rosencrantz.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Compare to see if pane status line has actually changed, not just size, and do not draw if pane is not visible.

* Fix a couple of problems with insert mode: flush dirty cells before we modify the screen, not after; and use grid_view_insert_cells to make space not grid_move_cells.

* bind-key -c has gone, remove from man page, and unused table declarations.

* Drop the edit mode key tables and just use fixed key bindings for the command prompt.

* Redraw selection in tty_draw_line, so it appears when redrawing whole pane. Reported by Theo Buehler.

* The repeat prompt in both emacs and vi (and the old one in tmux) doesn't support line editing and instead executes a command as soon as a non-number key is pressed. Add a -N flag to command-prompt for the same in copy mode. Reported by Theo Buehler.

* NetBSD needs _OPENBSD_SOURCE for reallocarray.

* Unused variable and missing time.h.

* Linux: #include <time.h> for time()

* Add missing function protype

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Some other stuff that can be local to one file.

* Add static in window-*.c and move some internal functions out of tmux.h.

* Support double and triple clicks (they are cumulative, so double is fired then triple), and use for select-word and select-line in copy mode. Inspired by a different solution from Omar Sandoval.

* Fundamental change to how copy mode key bindings work:

* Support UTF-8 entry into the command prompt.

* Add static in cmd-* and fix a few other nits.

* Loads more static, except for cmd-*.c and window-*.c.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Do not allow the opposite pane to resize when dragging with the mouse because it is not possible to keep the mouse on the border when the minimum size is reached.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Some more static.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Make the CLIENT_STATUS flag imply that pane status lines are redrawn if they are enabled and break the actual screen generation code into a separate function. Fixes problems reported by Romain Francoise.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Pass file/line to new command for if-shell so that errors appear sensibly.

* Handle NULL window or session for user options.

* Use xsnprintf not snprintf for the prompt in window_copy_write_line because we don't care if it is truncated to the screen width, we don't want it to be fatal.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* screen_write_copy tried to be clever and clear the line if it reached the end of the source, but it was wrong and causes problems that are only showing up now we are more aggressive about skipping redundant screen updates. Remove the optimization entirely as more trouble than it is worth to fix (and it'll have to go when BCE is done anyway).

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Wrap some long lines in screen-write.c.

* Keep buffer creation time and add accessors for it and the order number.

* Allow cmd_mouse_at return arguments to be NULL.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Remove some dead code in cmd-move-window.c and make a load of local functions static.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Document set-hook -u.

* Remove some redundant checks and make ich/dch consistent.

* Fix typos

* Start working on 2.4

* Release tmux 2.3

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Check padding when writing any character with width > 1, in case they overlap after the first character (for example with cells xy and ab, y is replacing a).

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Couple of vasprintf -> xvasprintf.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Rate limit TIOCSWINSZ on a timer to avoid programs getting hammered with SIGWINCH when the size changes rapidly. To help a problem reported by Rui Pinheiro.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Support set -a (append) with user options, suggested by Xandor Schiefer.

* Merge branch 'master' of github.com:tmux/tmux

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Swap watermarks from high (4096) to low (128) when we get full buffers into the read callback several times in succession; swap back when we see empty buffers several times. This hopefully limits how much programs that print a lot for a long period can monopolize tmux (like large, fast compiling), without penalizing programs that print a lot briefly (like most curses applications). Helps a lot for me, the actual numbers may need tweaking later.

* Do not use utf8proc by default.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Allow repeat count to be specified in mode key tables with bind-key -R, and set the default repeat count to 5 for WheelUp and WheelDown in copy-mode.

* Apple have changed their API again, from Gregory Pakosz.

* Use ncurses OR curses, don't mix header and library. Tested by Rob Paisley.

* Solaris build fixes from Rob Paisley.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add support for performing a full width split (with splitw -f), rather than splitting the current cell. From Stephen Kent.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Check for headers for ncurses and libevent as well as libraries.

* Remember the number of lines scrolled into the history (versus cleared into the history) and when resizing only use scrolled lines and not cleared lines (which are probably not intended to reappear). From Chaoren Lin.

* Add support for using utf8proc with --enable-utf8proc, useful for platforms (like OS X) where the system implementation is crap. From Joshua Rubin.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Kill empty window after moving pane and updating current window, so that index is still valid before renumber-windows happens. Fixes issue reported by Eric Pruitt.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Two minor fixes from dilyan palauzov.

* Merge branch 'master' of github.com:tmux/tmux

* Add to .mailmap.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Tweak output of environment logging.

* Log environment to new panes.

* Wrap some long lines and apply some static.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Don't update cells in each block of data read from a pane immediately, instead track them as change (dirty) and update them once at the end, saves much time if repeatedly writing the same cell. Also fix comparison of cells being equal in a few places (memcmp is not enough).

* Instead of representing colours in several different forms with various cell flags, convert to use an int with flags marking 256 or RGB colours in the top byte (except in cells, which we don't want to make any bigger). From Brad Town.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* tmux: only consider ACCESSPERMS for setting mode on socket_path.

* Remove duplicate daemon.c and time.h.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Allow a command to be specified to display-panes, similar to command-prompt, rather than always just selecting the pane.

* Linux: <time.h>

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add missing buffer_name format, from Awal Garg.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Copy mode needs to keep the original grid intact so it can copy from it if needed, so it disables reading from the pane. This can be problem with some programs. So make tmux automatically exit all modes after 180 seconds of inactivity and if there is pending output.

* Add -F to list-commands.

* Add *.dSYM for OS X.

* Merge branch 'master' of github.com:tmux/tmux

* Add to TODO.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Note how to subscribe to ML.

* Cache selected state so that cells going from selected to unselected are not skipped, reported by Omar Sandoval.

* Insert new panes after the pane being split in the list rather than always after the active pane. This is more sensible when doing it with commands rather than keys.

* Allow #[] in window-status-separator.

* Updated link for bash(1) completions.

* Update TODO.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Cache the window styles and do not look up the window-style options unless they have changed.

* Do not draw character to screen if it has not changed, and do not save last character if it won't be used. This (and last few commits) prompted by a report from Hubert depesz Lubaczewski.

* Send two cub1 instead of using cub for moving the cursor two left. This is normally better because using cub1 will be ^H^H (so two bytes) but cub would be ^[[2D (four).

* No longer set __progname, we have getprogname().

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Padding cell is always the same so use a static.

* Break the save-last-cell code into a separate function (so it can be called conditionally later).

* Most of the utf8_data is fixed so simplify utf8_set to use a memcpy.

* __progname -> getprogname()

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Use getprogname() instead of __progname to make portability easier.

* Merge branch 'master' of github.com:tmux/tmux

* getprogname() and setproctitle() on Linux.

* Add flag for -pg.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Extend 0x1234 keys form to more bits so that Unicode keys work.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Just nuke environ instead of trying to unsetenv everything because that doesn't necessarily work if there is an entry with an empty name.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Use a fixed buffer for strftime() because there is no portable way to tell if the buffer is too small, and an expanding buffer is overkill anyway.

* Remove unused variable, from Ben Boeckel.

* Use osdep_event_init() so that LIBEVENT_NOEPOLL and so on are set to turn off broken event methods. Reported by Suraj N Kurapati.

* Merge branch 'master' of github.com:tmux/tmux

* Fix a typo, issue 406.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* set-hook needs CANFAIL like the other set commands.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add on alerts rather than ignoring them if the event has already been queued, for example bell and activity together. From Marcel Lippmann via Romain Francoise.

* Add --static to PKG_CONFIG rather than replacing it.

* Do not mention OpenBSD FAQ.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Expand client formats (like run-shell), from Stephen M Coakley.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Compact a small table into text.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add option to include status text in the pane borders. If pane-border-status is set to "top" or "bottom" (rather than "off"), every pane has a permanent top or bottom border containing the text from pane-border-format.

* Final parts of command hooks, add before- and after- hooks to each command.

* The backoff timer is causing no end of trouble with disconnected clients stopping data in attached ones. So get rid of it and see how we get on with just a high watermark on each pane.

* Make the grid_cell passed into screen_write_* const.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Only assume width 1 when wcwidth() returns -1 on non-OpenBSD platforms.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Fix keys parsing again to correctly accept Unicode when not prefixed with Escape.

* OpenBSD wcwidth() is sensible and complete so if it returns -1 it means that a character is not printable, so return to ignoring such characters.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* memmove() the right size when expanding tree.

* After unlock, Update activity time after recalculate_sizes() so that the session attached flag is correct.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Apply backspace check after working out the actual key, so that M-BSpace can work.

* Merge branch 'master' of github.com:tmux/tmux

* Add to TODO.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add next/previous paragraph, from J Raynor.

* Loads of platforms appear to have old or broken Unicode character type information and are missing widths for relatively common Unicode characters (so mbtowc() works, but wcwidth() fails). So if wcwidth() returns -1, assume a width of 1 instead of ignoring the character.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Simplify next key matching and fix problems with meta and Unicode keys.

* No more array.h.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Remove last uses of array.h.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Log wcwidth() and mbtowc() failure to make it easier to debug a Unicode codepoint not appearing.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Don't overwrite modifiers in the buffer when making UTF-8 strings, append instead.

* Start working on 2.3

* Add CHANGES notes for 2.2 release

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* fatalx() not fatal().

* Merge branch 'master' of github.com:tmux/tmux

* Add --disable-utempter to build without it.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Bump the listen() backlog up, some people have scripts that run up a lot of clients quickly.

* Look for utempter_add_record to be sure we have the new utempter API, the old utempter API was also using utempter.h.

* Add to TODO.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Make scrolling behaviour more sensible and maintain cursor position, as if the same had been done line-by-line. From Michal Mazurek.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Instead of reusing MouseUp at the finish of a drag, add a new key MouseDragEnd. It can be useful to bind them separately in copy mode.

* Tweak a comment.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* If setlocale("en_US.UTF-8") succeeds, then don't do the check for UTF-8 locale since if it isn't UTF-8 the system is broken anyway. If it fails, try "" and check for UTF-8 with nl_langinfo(CODESET) rather than wcwidth(). Based on a diff from schwarze@, nl_langinfo also suggested by stsp@.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Do not use c->cwd or s->cwd if it is NULL, found by Ben Boeckel.

* Although we always have en_US.UTF-8 on OpenBSD, some platforms do not, so fall back to setlocale(LC_CTYPE, ""). tmux requires a UTF-8 locale, so check with wcwidth() on a UTF-8 character after setlocale().

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* show-* and set-* need to handle a missing target.

* Accept clients as sessions in cmd_find_get_session.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* RGB colours shouldn't be mixed up with aixterm colours, return before that happens when working out if they are supported.

* +wchar.h

* Merge branch 'next'

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Handle wcwidth() and mbtowc() failures in better style and drop characters where we can't find the width (wcwidth() fails) on input, the same as we drop invalid UTF-8. Suggested by schwarze@.

* Limit x, y and b to 0x7ff for UTF-8 mouse input, suggested by schwarze@.

* Remove some more unused variables, and use RB_FOREACH_SAFE in key_bindings_unref_table.

* Redraw status on mode entry and exit.

* When a mouse drag is finished, fire a MouseUp key press, instead of doing the drag end in code. From Stephen Coakley.

* Remove unused variables, from Michal Mazurek.

* Use system wcwidth() instead of carrying around UTF-8 width tables.

* Fix break-pane synopsis and some other tmux.1 bits.

* Remove unused variables.

* Add to TODO.

* Merge branch 'master' into next

* Fixed fgetln(3) implementation (from Joerg Jung) which does not depend on *BSD fgets(3) semantics.

* Redraw status on mode entry and exit.

* When a mouse drag is finished, fire a MouseUp key press, instead of doing the drag end in code. From Stephen Coakley.

* Remove unused variables, from Michal Mazurek.

* Use system wcwidth() instead of carrying around UTF-8 width tables.

* Remove malloc_options debug bit (already gone from OpenBSD).

* Fire SIGCHLD after utempter_add_record since it probably eats it.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Expand client formats in run-shell.

* xmalloc: define __bounded__ where necessary

* EXTRA_DIST: add example_tmux.conf / xmalloc.h

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Clear RGB flags during selection.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Whoops, need this for the previous reverse trim commit too.

* Add RGB escape sequences for capture-pane -e.

* Support negative trim values (#{=-10:pane_title}) to trim from the end, suggested by Kevin Brubeck Unhammer.

* Fix new-session with -t after command flags changes, reported by Michael Graczyk.

* examples/ has gone, so delete some text about it.

* Remove old examples in favour of one example configuration file.

* Link to the bash(1) completion file from README rather than including it in examples.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Support for RGB colour, using the extended cell mechanism to avoid wasting unnecessary space. The 'Tc' flag must be set in the external TERM entry (using terminal-overrides or a custom terminfo entry), if not tmux will map to the closest of the 256 or 16 colour palettes.

* libevent.org URL.

* Update my email address.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Split out getting the current state from the target search so it can be replaced if we already know the current.

* I no longer use my SourceForge address so replace it.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add hooks for alerts (bell, silence, activity), from Thomas Adam.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Clear the environment properly by looping until it is empty rather than looping over it (which may skip entries), from Brad King.

* A couple of missing printflike attributes, from Andrey Starodubtsev.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* clock-mode needs CMD_PANE.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Don't rely on a calculation wrapping when applying message-limit, and break out of the loop early. From Nicolas Viennot.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Remove an extra unzoom call which was probably a merge error.

* Use saved pipe buffer offset when writing to pipe, from Nicolas Viennot.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Make input off flag (selectp -d) apply to synchronize-panes too.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* As well as setting up the state, actually use it in cmd_find_target.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* send-keys -R should reset the input parser to ground state (so it can be used to escape from, for example, printf '\033]2;').

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add infrastructure to work out the best target given a pane or window alone and use it to add pane_died and pane_exited hooks.

* showenv and setenv need to be CANFAIL.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Copy state directly rather than dereferencing wl (which could be NULL).

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Some hooks API changes to fire a hook while waiting another cmdq and infrastructure that will be needed soon.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Allow list-keys and list-commands to be run without a running server.

* We changed somewhat recently to us the pty when tmux was run inside itself to work out the current pane. This is confusing in many cases (particularly notable is that "tmux neww\; splitw" would not split the new window), and the few advantages do not make up for the confusion.

* Don't copy marked pane when can just point to it.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Make the marked pane a cmd_find_state.

* Use cmd_find_clear_state instead of an extra function doing the same.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Remove some stray debug code.

* Instead of combined flags for -c, -s, -t, split into different sets using an enum and simplify the parsing code.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Use member names in cmd_entry definitions so I stop getting confused about the order.

* Actually I thought cmd_get_state_client was unnecessary but it will be needed.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* -c needs to be able for fail for display-message.

* Remove an unnecessary function.

* show-options and environment need CANFAIL flag.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Don't log an error when doing the first check for move-window.

* Use struct cmd_find_state directly and remove cmd_state_flag, also change so that winlink is set even if an index is too.

* Change cmd_find_target to use a state struct from the caller.

* If command returns error, report it.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Remove the cmd_find_{session,window,pane,index} functions (which are just wrappers around cmd_find_target) and just use cmd_find_target directly.

* Move logging into cmd_find_target rather than each function.

* Instead of every command resolving the target (-t or -s) itself, prepare the state (client, session, winlink, pane) for it it before entering the command. Each command provides some flags that tell the prepare step what it is expecting.

* Need to use pkg-config --static when doing a static build.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add key-table option to set the default key table for a session, allows different key bindings for different sessions and a few other things.

* Return after changing key table.

* Allow prefix and prefix2 to be set to None to disable (useful if you would rather bind the prefix in the root table).

* Merge branch 'master' of github.com:tmux/tmux

* Look for ncurses with PKG_CONFIG, and remove libtinfo because it just causes confusion.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Style nits and line wrapping of function declarations.

* Mention {src,dst}-{window,pane} where we define target-{window,pane}.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* We cannot do hooks_find and then hooks_remove because it might have come from the parent (global) tree, instead make it remove by name like options.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Check alerts when session changes, from Patrick Palka.

* Add cmdq as an argument to format_create and add a format for the command name (will also be used for more later).

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add to .mailmap, and sort.

* Remove format_create_flags and just pass flags to format_create.

* Spacing nits.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Conflicts: 	Makefile

* Ed was meant to be El;

* Add hooks infrastructure, basic commands (set-hook, show-hooks) and a couple of not very useful client hooks. This will eventually let commands be run at various points and on notifications. Joint work with Thomas Adam.

* Use ^= instead of a verbose alternative. ok nicm@

* termios(4)

* pty(7) -> pty(4)

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Delete a duplicated line

* Do not set a limit on the length of commands when printing them.

* Add to TODO.

* log_open() isn't conditional on proctitle

* Remove logfile()

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Don't print error if none to print.

* Make environ_set va_args and use it to tidy up some calls. Also add a missing word in manpage (from jmc).

* Shell command from -c doesn't have to be global, pass it as an argument.

* Do lock failures slightly better, return a special value so we don't unlink the wrong thing.

* Actually show something (even if it not that helpful) if the server fails to start (for example if it can't create the socket), rather than hanging or showing nothing.

* Document socket_path format.

* Tidy the code that works out the socket path, and just use the full path in the global socket_path rather than copying it.

* Remove malloc_options DEBUG bit.

* Switch a fprintf to a fatal, and wrap some long lines.

* Remove the -I part of show-messages which isn't really that useful; the server start time can now be accessed with a new start_time format (use: tmux display -p '#{t:start_time}')

* All kill-session -C to clear alerts in all windows, suggested by Aaron U'Ren.

* Log some system and libevent information at startup.

* Show libevent version in showmsgs -I.

* Make the log stuff a bit tidier with some helper functions.

* Fix usage of detach-client.

* Merge branch 'master' of github.com:tmux/tmux

* -sys/queue.h in proc.c, and nuke the unnecessary C++ header guards stuff and sys/cdefs.h in vis.h (it causes problems on some platforms). Reported by someone on GitHub, issue 212.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Don't allow options in table without scope set.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Partly revert previous, it is harmless to keep support for UTF-8 mouse mode inside tmux, just no longer support it for tmux itself.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Remove support for the UTF-8 mouse extension. This was a briefly used, poor idea that was fairly quickly replaced by SGR mouse input (which is now widespread). It is impossible to tell the difference between UTF-8 and non-UTF-8 mouse input; since the mouse-utf8 option was removed tmux has not handled it correctly in any case; and it is ridiculous to have three different forms of mouse input.

* Don't leak extddata, memset after freeing it, not before. From Patrick Palka.

* Add getpw to pledge, makes tmux work in YP environments, discovered by matthieu, ok deraadt

* If display-time is set to 0, show status messages until a key is pressed; OK nicm@

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Move tmux.h below system includes.

* Memory leaks and an uninitialized part of utf8_data, from Patrick Palka.

* The alerts callback should be fired for bells even if bell-action is none because it also affects the status line bell indicator (and bell-action does not). Fixes a problem reported by tim@.

* Instead of separate tables for different types of options, give each option a scope type (server, session, window) in one table.

* Only assume pasting with at least two characters, reduces problems for people who can type ^B c very fast, or who are using tmux inside something else that buffers.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* The activity flag could already be set, so queue the callback always (if not already queued) rather than only if the flag is being added. Fixes a problem reported by tim@

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Use format_expand_time for display-message.

* unused -> __unused.

* Merge branch 'master' of github.com:tmux/tmux

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add __unused, will be needed shortly.

* Use __unused rather than rolling our own.

* Add s/foo/bar/: prefix for formats to substitute bar for foo.

* Add -Wno-attributes.

* Add reallocarray prototype.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Sync the entire xmalloc.[ch] with the other users, but with the addition of xrealloc, xvasprintf, xvsnprintf.

* Merge branch 'master' of github.com:tmux/tmux

* Add reallocarray to compat.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Don't update activity time twice for new sessions, and add some logging.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge xmalloc.[ch] files across base, skipping OpenSSH for now.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* 0x7f is a valid key.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Make key_code unsigned long long not uint64_t which is more portable for printf formats, and move UTF8_SIZE define down to near the rest of the UTF-8 bits.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Accidentally turned off pledge, turn it back on.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* The character is an int so use %x not %hhx.

* The private use area at U+E000 to U+F8FF is not very useful if it is width 0, make it width 1 instead.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* All these return values from utf8_* are confusing, use an enum.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Rename a variable in utf8_combine for consistency and use 0xfffd for unknown Unicode.

* Couple of assignments to remove compiler warnings.

* Be more strict about invalid UTF-8.

* Push stdout and stderr to clients more aggressively, and add an event to continue if the send fails.

* Merge branch 'master' of github.com:tmux/tmux

* Update the TODO file.

* Log more of UTF-8 input.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Log option names in fatal() for missing option.

* Merge branch 'master' of github.com:tmux/tmux

* utf8 option is gone.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Two spacing and spelling nits.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add window_visible_layout which ignores zoomed panes and use it for control mode (which needs to know all panes), from George Nachman.

* Long overdue change to the way we store cells in the grid: now, instead of storing a full grid_cell with UTF-8 data and everything, store a new type grid_cell_entry. This can either be the cell itself (for ASCII cells), or an offset into an extended array (per line) for UTF-8 data.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Rename overly-long utf8data to ud throughout.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* grid_put_utf8 is unused, remove it.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add utf8_padcstr and use it to align columns in list-keys.

* tweak previous; ok nicm

* Tidy utf8.c a little: build table on first use, and make utf8_width take a u_int rather than splitting and then combining again in utf8_split.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* tmux is UTF-8, so if $TMUX is set (tmux running in tmux), the client is UTF-8. Also try to make the existing checks more readable.

* If we know the terminal outside tmux is not UTF-8, replace UTF-8 in error messages and whatnot with underscores the same as we do when we draw UTF-8 characters as part of the screen.

* Nuke the utf8 and status-utf8 options and make tmux only a UTF-8 terminal. We still support non-UTF-8 terminals outside tmux, but inside it is always UTF-8 (as when the utf8 and status-utf8 options were on).

* Remove the mouse_utf8_flag format as well.

* Support UTF-8 key bindings by expanding the key type from int to uint64_t and converting UTF-8 to Unicode on input and the reverse on output. (This allows key bindings, there are still omissions - the largest being that the various prompts do not accept UTF-8.)

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Default history-file should be "" not NULL, from Greg Onufe.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Drop mouse-utf8 option and always turn on UTF-8 mouse if the client says it supports UTF-8.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* If realpath() fails just try the original path.

* Handle absolute paths properly, and don't use resolved path in realpath() fails.

* Same bug as last commit, but in the other copy of the loop in this file...

* Update the internal wcwidth(3) table of tmux(1) to match the data in /usr/src/share/locale/ctype/en_US.UTF-8.src, with one single exception:  Keep U+00AD SOFT HYPHEN at width 1 rather than moving it to width 0, a tradition already observed in the old https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/wcwidth.c . While here, manually rebalance the btree for optimal lookup speed. OK nicm@

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Pass through right click if mouse is on, from Patrick Palka.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Detach the client we are looping over, from Thomas Adam.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Fall back silently to ~ or / rather than checking -c with access(), this was the old behaviour.

* Don't shift version out of peerid, it is needed later.

* The output log is only useful once and it means creating a file, so open it once at startup instead of in every call to tty_open.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Because pledge(2) does not allow us to pass directory file descriptors around, we can't use file descriptors for the working directory because we will be unable to pass it to a privileged process to tell it where to read or write files or spawn children. So move tmux back to using strings for the current working directory. We try to check it exists with access() when it is set but ultimately fall back to ~ if it fails at time of use (or / if that fails too).

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Break version check into a separate function, and limit version to 8 bits.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Like options, move the environ struct into environ.c.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Move struct options into options.c.

* No more TMPDIR.

* Break the common process set up, event loop and imsg dispatch code between server and client out into a separate internal API. This will make it easier to add another process.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Count brackets in #{?...} so that nested conditional formats work, from Daniel De Graaf.

* The format callback may not always succeed, so we need to check for NULL. From Patrick Palka.

* Use copy-mode -et= in WheelUpPane binding, from Patrick Palka.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* If a mouse event has no key binding, pass it through to the pane it happened in, not the active pane like normal key presses. Fixes problems seen by Enrico Ghirardi.

* Default bindings for mouse wheel on status line to change window (like we had before), from Patrick Palka.

* Handle unknown keys more gracefully, return a string instead of NULL.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Some extra logging of where keys are actually going.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* space before punctuation;

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Extend the modifiers allowed before formats: as well as the existing #{=10:...}  length limit, add #{t:...} to convert a time_t format to a string, #{b:...} for basename and #{d:...} for dirname. Remove all the foo_string time formats as they can now be replaced by "t:", for example #{window_activity_string} becomes #{t:window_activity}.

* Pass output from jobs through format_expand() so they are expanded again (this was the previous behaviour).

* Let's see if anyone screams about not being able to specify $TMPDIR for their tmux sockets.

* Pasting mouse escape sequences is unlikely, so skip them when working out whether the user is pasting.

* Remove some unnecessary checks before free().

* If $TMUX is set, and we are unsure about the session, use it.

* tmux can call pledge() in main with large set and then reduce it slightly in the server to "stdio rpath wpath cpath fattr unix recvfd proc exec tty ps".

* Format for scroll position, from Jorge Morante.

* Use tty_term_flag not _has for XT, and make -2 force direct use of 256-colour escape sequences (so setaf/setab can be bypassed if needed).

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* If the pane is still on all_window_panes but not actually connected to window or session (which can happen if it is killed during a command sequence and something else has a reference), fall back to the best effort. Fixes "tmux killw\; detach" for Rudis Muiznieks.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Adding colors=256 to *256color* was always pretty stupid and now it won't work (without adding setaf@:setab@ too).

* If the terminal has colors=256, only try to use setaf/setab if they exist, reported by Filipe Brandenburger.

* Move tzset() from log_open to main.

* Style nit, int for flags not u_int.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* When the active pane changes, redraw panes if the style has changed. From Cam Hutchison.

* Make refresh-client force update of jobs, from Sina Siadat.

* Add copy-mode -e to exit copy mode when scrolling off the bottom, useful for quick view of history, from Cam Hutchison.

* Set woken flag when flushing so that the channel is freed, while here use the same loop construct for both loops.

* Merge delete-buffer into cmd-set-buffer.c and change the paste buffer API so it has one paste_free() rather than free_top and free_name (everywhere that uses it already has the right pointer).

* Add --enable-coverage for gcov.

* Fix bad merge.

* Fix includes

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Change wait-for to work when the signal comes before the wait, also use some helper functions and add some logging.

* A couple of style nits.

* Log pane which received input data.

* A one line helper function is a little silly.

* We no longer need the terminal service class, so don't bother asking for it.

* Fix indentation of grid_string_cells_fg.

* Some style nits and dead assignments.

* Remove some old prototypes and unused functions.

* struct args_entry can go into arguments.c.

* paste_send_pane can be merged into cmd-paste-buffer.c now.

* Move struct paste_buffer out of tmux.h.

* We already loop over the windows in server_client_loop, so don't do it again in server_loop just to check names.

* Move alerts onto events rather than checking every loop.

* Treat entering or leaving a mode as pane changed.

* Better take on reducing the name timer. Again check for name changes in the main loop after events that may have changed the pane, but do so at most once every 500 millis. If the pane changed too soon, use a timer to ensure that a check happens later.

* Microseconds in log time.

* Only set default title to hostname on screens that are being used for a window pane, no point in calling gethostname() for temporary screens.

* Make a few more expensive (ish) formats functions instead of inline.

* Allow formats to be specified as functions (in the code) so they are only evaluated on demand rather than each time a format tree is constructed. Use this for expensive formats like pane_current_command.

* Revert previous; we do need a timer, until I have a better idea. We can't do the name check every loop, because that is too expensive, and we can't make sure it only happens infrequently because we have no idea when the next change will happen.

* We now only checking for name changes when the active pane has changed, but that can only happen when we have already been woken up by a read event, so there is no need for a timer, we can just check the changed flag on the end of that read event (we already loop over the windows to check for bells etc anyway).

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Check changed flag after restarting timer.

* Remove unused prototypes.

* Don't leak name when freeing session, from Kuang-che Wu.

* Per-session timers for locking, and remove the global one-second timer.

* Make session_update_activity more useful and use it in more places.

* Remove the lock-server option which is a bit redundant, it isn't that different without it.

* Update tmux.vim from Ben Boeckel.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Do not call window_unzoom from window_destroy because it will try to add a notification which will get confused because the reference count is already zero and end up back in window_destroy and a double free. Instead, just destroy the layouts directly. Noticed by Thomas Adam.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Ignore environment variables that are too long to send to the server.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Fix line endings.

* Initialize cwd fd to -1 so that we don't close fd 0 if the client is destroyed before it is changed. Also allow ttyname() to fail. Fixes problems when running out of file descriptors reported by Bruno Sutic.

* Add a format to show if client is a control client. From Bruno Sutic.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add a -s flag to show-environment to output Bourne shell commands a la ssh-agent. Mostly from Cam Hutchison with some changes by me.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Break cmdq_continue inner loop into a helper function.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Move the shuffle code from new-window -a into a function and add a -a flag for move-window too. From Thomas Adam.

* Use an explicit job state instead of avoid closing our side of the socketpair and setting it to -1 to mark when the other side is closed. This avoids closing it while the libevent bufferevent still has it (it could try to add it to the polled set which some mechanisms don't like). Fixes part a problem reported by Bruno Sutic.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add window_activity format, from Thomas Adam based on a diff originally from propos6 at gmail dot com.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add a format for client PID (client_pid) and server PID (pid). Diff for client_pid from Thomas Adam.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch 'master' of github.com:tmux/tmux

* Don't leak dotfd if fchdir fails. From ettl dot martin78 at gmail dot com.

* wp->tty is a char [] not a char * so it can't be NULL. From Thomas Adam.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Fix loop comparison broken in last commit, from Thomas Adam.

* It isn't supposed to...

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add -E flag when attaching or switching client to bypass update-environment, from Steven Lu.

* Update TODO.

* Use ints for the calculations rather than u_char, they could end up signed.

* Handle the RGB colour escape sequence (\033[38;2;<r>;<g>;<b>m and 48;2) like xterm(1) does, by mapping to the nearest in the 256 colour palette.

* Use fixed colour tables rather than generated and do a quick search for exact match before doing the distance comparison.

* Similarly, for sessions use a callback to free rather than checking every loop.

* Change deref to the more sensible unref, and add a couple I missed before.

* Instead of putting dead clients on a list and checking it every loop, use event_once to queue a callback to deal with them. Also dead clients with references would never actually be freed because the wrap-up functions (the callback for stdin, or status_prompt_clear) would never be called. So call them in server_client_lost.

* Do not use the key variable uninitialized (in a debug log statement), reported by jungleboogie0 at gmail dot com.

* Only need *.ch in compat.

* Fix a warning.

* Make it so that if a window or session target is prefixed with an =, only an exact name or index match is accepted, no special character, prefix match, or fnmatch.

* Move the nested check from client to server and compare the client tty name to all the pane pty names instead of comparing socket paths. This means that "new -d" will work without unsetting $TMUX.

* tweak SYNOPSIS and usage();

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Make unsetting a global option restore it to the default. Diff lying around for a while, I have forgotten who suggested it :-/.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add support for a single "marked pane". There is one marked pane in the server at a time; it may be toggled or cleared with select-pane -m and -M (the border is highlighted). A new target '~' or '{marked}' specifies the marked pane to commands and it is the default target for the swap-pane and join-pane -s flag (this makes them much simpler to use - mark the source pane and then change to the target pane to run swapp or joinp).

* Spaces -> tabs.

* Update mailmap.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* does not need syslog.h

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Don't use special strings if #() commands fail, just remove the format (as if the command produced nothing). Makes constructions that can fail like '#(test whatever && echo foo)' work as they did before.

* Expand formats again inside #(), and free the temporaries.

* Use RB_MIN to get the lowest index for the current window when creating grouped sessions, rather than using RB_ROOT.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Move the jobs output cache into the formats code so that #() work more generally (for example, again working in set-titles-string).

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Return empty string if format is empty rather than attempting to allocate zero bytes.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* In terminfo, sometimes cvvis implies cnorm and sometimes it doesn't, so don't assume it does. Fixes missing cursor with emacs-in-tmux-in-tmux.

* README.md: github-specific readme

* TRAVIS-CI: correct path to configure

* Hook repo to Travis-CI

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* To replace c0-*, add a high watermark to the pty event, and also backoff when the any of the ttys the pane is going to write to has buffered enough data.

* Tidy blank lines when outputting server info.

* Add a session_alerts format which is a list of all the alerts in the current session in symbolic form (something like "0!,4~,5!"). Use this in the default set-titles-string. Prompted by a request from Jan ONDREJ.

* Add bell-action "other" to pass through bells in all windows except the current, suggested by Jan ONDREJ.

* Left the c0-* options behind in the table.

* Remove the c0-* options which never really worked satisfactorily. Going to try something else...

* Add back __CYGWIN__ block

* Merge branch 'master' of ssh://git.code.sf.net/p/tmux/tmux-code

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Put the tty structs together, and tabify.

* grid_marker_cell is no longer used.

* mode_key_entry can go into mode-key.c; also a few spaces->tabs.

* window_choose_mode_item can move into window-choose.c.

* Move input parser structs into input.c (removing fairly useless saved_cursor_[xy] formats as a side-effect).

* Remove some stuff that accidentally ended up here from portable, and remove a little-used debug function.

* Update environment when switching sessions as well as attaching, from Si Beaumont.

* Style spacing nits.

* queue.h should come from compat.h.

* array.h can be local to window-choose.c now.

* Use a TAILQ not array for find-window.

* Simplify environ_push so it doesn't need the ARRAY_* functions.

* If status line is at the top, the offset needs to be adjusted when drawing pane numbers.  Based on a diff from John O'Meara.

* Remove ARRAY_* from history and expand completion to complete a) layout names and b) targets beginning with -t or -s.

* Start working on 2.1

* CHANGES for tmux 2.0

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add a format window_linked which is 1 if a window has been linked multiple times, also remove the default space in window_flags and use a conditional to add it in window-status-format (this means additional flags can be added in the option without extra spaces). From Thomas Adam with tweaks by me.

* Turn cursor off during redraw, pointed out by George Nachman.

* Use the right index when expanding/collapsing tree, from Thomas Adam.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Do not complain when directions fail.

* If default-terminal is set to "screen" or "screen-*", emulate screen's historical (incorrect) behaviour for SGR 3 and send smso (standout). Previously, we would send sitm (italics) if the terminal outside had it and smso otherwise. This was acceptably until recently because xterm's terminfo entry lacked sitm, so most users got smso.

* Add tmux4.png.

* Renumber screenshots.

* Merge branch 'master' of ssh://git.code.sf.net/p/tmux/tmux-code

* Update two of the screenshots.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* But this does work.

* Upload all the files.

* This doesn't work.

* Add logo to www, also centre the page.

* Add tmux logo, createed by Jason Long.

* If looking for an index, don't fill in window when given a session.

* Do not do a search for the tty path if there isn't one.

* If can't find pane as a pane, try as a window; likewise if can't find window as a session.

* Add select-layout -o to undo the last layout change (apply the previously set layout).

* No paths.h on Solaris.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Do not include unattached clients when trying to find one for target.

* Reset cfg_ncauses to 0 as well or we could allocate the wrong size if called again.

* Assign to the right variable when comparing clients.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Rewrite of the target resolution internals to be simpler and more consistent but with much less duplication, but keeping the same internal API. Also adds more readable aliases for some of the special tokens used in targets (eg "{start}" instead of "^"). Some behaviours may have changed, for example prefix matches now happen before fnmatch.

* If the requested pane is already active, do not unzoom the window (or do anything else). Prevents mouse clicking when zoomed causing unzoom, reported by Jose Antonio Delgado Alfonso (with a different fix).

* Remove panes from layout if spawning them fails, reported by Anthony J Bentley.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Get rid of window_choose_list type.

* Fix some char* -> char *.

* Use a char **,u_int pair for cfg_causes.

* Make message log a TAILQ.

* Move the functions to convert ids from strings into session.c and window.c.

* Explicitly cancel mouse "button" mode, this happens implicitly with some one of the other things we send with xterm, but not with urxvt. Reported by sthen@.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Convert clients list into a TAILQ.

* Set working directory for run-shell and if-shell.

* Allow choice options (multiple states) to be toggled between states 0 and 1.

* Set up signal handler earlier so that we don't get zombies, reported by sobrado@.

* use reallocarray instead of calloc; avoid the zero before infill ok nicm

* Make session_has return a flag, returning the first winlink found is a recipe for errors.

* Change the windows array into an RB tree and fix some places where we were only looking at the first winlink for a window in a session.

* window_index is only used in one place (window_destroy) so inline it there.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Look up indexes as number before name, makes more sense if windows are named starting with numbers. From Thomas Adam.

* Always format real layout even when zoomed.

* Do not die on USR1 if any of the socket parent directories are missing. Reported by Robin Powell.

* Simplify error messages when socket connect fails, suggested by "Karthik K".

* The free callback could end up being fired before the done callback (happens on Cygwin), so use a reference count instead of a single flag. SF bug 188 reported by "iceboy".

* Fix moving windows to nonexistent indexes when renumber-windows is off. From Thomas Adam, reported by Daniel Levai and Theo Buehler.

* Bind mouse dragging so that it is passed through to applications if they want it rather than entering copy mode.

* Don't eat the mouse event that triggers a drag end because we may want to pass it on to application inside the pane.

* Put mouse_any_flag back, don't know where it went to (still in man page).

* Pass mouse events through to commands for if-shell.

* cmd_mouse_pane can return NULL, check for that.

* Remove unused-but-set variables, from Thomas Adam.

* Support for multiple key tables to commands to be bound to sequences of keys. The default key bindings become the "prefix" table and -n the "root" table. Keys may be bound in new tables with bind -T and switch-client -T used to specify the table in which the next key should be looked up. Based on a diff from Keith Amling.

* Style nit - unnecessary brackets.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Make jump-to-backward/jump-to-forward repeatable with jump-reverse/jump-again, from Jacob Niehus.

* Use a more sensible buffer size for flags string.

* +.

* tweak previous;

* Honour renumber-windows when unlinking a window, from Thomas Adam.

* Rewrite of tmux mouse support which was a mess. Instead of having options for "mouse-this" and "mouse-that", mouse events may be bound as keys and there is one option "mouse" that turns on mouse support entirely (set -g mouse on).

* Support setting the default window and pane background colours (window and active pane via window-style and window-active-style options, an individual pane by a new select-pane -P flag). From J Raynor.

* +.

* +.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Fix some issues in bright colour handling. Bold background doesn't exist so there is no reason for tty_check_bg to mess with the BRIGHT flag at all, ever. Also use aixterm colours for 256-to-16 translation if the terminal supports them. And there is no reason for tty_colours_bg to worry about whether the terminal supports them - tty_check_bg has already taken care of it.

* Use tty_term_flag not _has for flags, also fix a typo (position not permission).

* Fix setting old-style window -fg/-bg/-attr options that aren't global.

* Add a -x flag to copy-selection, append-selection and start-named-buffer to prevent it exiting copy mode after copying. From J Raynor with a few tweaks by me.

* in the case -> in this case.

* When replacing, don't free the old paste until after the new one's name has been copied. Fixes a use-after-free in window-copy.c. Bug reported by J Raynor (who also provided a different fix).

* Add a helper function to convert time, and add session_activity formats (the latter from Takatoshi Matsumoto).

* Fix some format specifier nits, from Ben Boeckel.

* Make place const to avoid a warning, from Ben Boeckel.

* set-titles-string now uses formats, not the status bits (so no #() for now). Reported by landry.

* Explicitly look for cpp and egrep to avoid AC_EGREP_CPP messing up output.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch 'master' of ssh://git.code.sf.net/p/tmux/tmux-code

* Merge branch 'tmp'

* When given an invalid style, don't set the option to the default. Fix from J Raynor. Also make style_parse not alter the grid_cell when it fails.

* Remove LocalWords.

* Revert "Add -Wno-format-nonliteral to Makefile.am"

* Add -Wno-format-nonliteral to Makefile.am

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Take a reference to prevent cmdq being freed during the command. Can happen to cfg_cmd_q (possibly others) when source-file recurses into cmdq_continue. Fixes bug reported by Ismail Donmez and Theo Buehler.

* Merge clock-mode command into copy-mode.

* Add a note about cmd_find_*.

* Entries in the window list can be NULL, prompted by a crash seen by Ben Boeckel.

* Check for \0 in the right place, from J Raynor.

* Use the same time for both calls to format_expand_time.

* No paths.h on Solaris.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* status_replace can now become local to status.c and it no longer needs the jobsflag argument. While here there is no need to repeat work that format_defaults already does.

* Use formats not status_replace for set-titles-string.

* Add format_expand_time and use it instead of status_replace where command execution is not needed.

* Move pane border options to window options rather than session, from Marc Finet.

* Reset bracket paste mode on detach.

* Remove a couple of now-unused variables.

* Wrap all the individual format_* calls in a single format_defaults functions.

* There is no need to save the guard state because the function checks it again anyway.

* Remove two unused arguments from status_replace.

* Tidy up detach-client a bit.

* Focus off needs to be sent with tty_raw, reported by Geoff Nixon.

* has-session is now part of new-session.

* Merge branch 'master' of ssh://git.code.sf.net/p/tmux/tmux-code

* Don't leak the individual strings when copying environment.

* Spaces to tabs.

* In options-table.c r1.51 an extra space was added to the default status-right, overrunning status-right-length with long window titles. Allow for the extra space so the last digit of the year isn't lost.  ok nicm@

* typo in comment ;)  ok nicm

* Support blinking cursor mode, both the xterm CSI ?12 h/l and (the backwards) screen CSI 34 h/l. From Guanpeng Xu.

* Make a tmux-%u directory under TMUX_TMPDIR, like TMPDIR.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Replace <sys/param.h> with <limits.h> and other less dirty headers where possible.  Annotate <sys/param.h> lines with their current reasons.  Switch to PATH_MAX, NGROUPS_MAX, HOST_NAME_MAX+1, LOGIN_NAME_MAX, etc.  Change MIN() and MAX() to local definitions of MINIMUM() and MAXIMUM() where sensible to avoid pulling in the pollution.  These are the files confirmed through binary verification. ok guenther, millert, doug (helped with the verification protocol)

* Remove an unnecessary variable and shorten a line.

* Shorten some long lines.

* Merge branch 'master' of ssh://git.code.sf.net/p/tmux/tmux-code

* We do not need to add /usr/local to CPPFLAGS; if configure managed to pass then the dependencies must already be in the search path. Reported by Romain Naour.

* correctly use HOST_NAME_MAX.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Revert to r1.16 since this is still clearly broken and I can't see how right now.

* Unzoom before kill, from Thomas Adam.

* Add missing default bindings, from Theo Buehler.

* Need param.h, from Ismail Donmez.

* Merge branch 'master' of ssh://git.code.sf.net/p/tmux/tmux-code

* t_kP is the same as PageUp, so no need for it, from Daniel Hahler.

* Merge branch 'master' of ssh://git.code.sf.net/p/tmux/tmux-code

* Notify on zoom/unzoom, from George Nachmann.

* Only redraw affected lines when selection changes with mouse. From Michael Graczyk.

* Merge branch 'master' of ssh://git.code.sf.net/p/tmux/tmux-code

* Add missing va_end, from Thomas Jarosch.

* Add pane_dead_status for exit status of dead panes.

* Tweak ordering and whitespace.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add -F to if-shell to allow it to be used to check for format or option values rather than executing a command.

* Permit option values to be used in formats.

* Another fix for insertion from Balazs Kezes. On insertion, size the line just enough for the inserted characters.

* Check ZOOMED flag on window.

* Remove dead code, from Thomas Adam.

* Prefer setvbuf() to setlinebuf() for portability; ok deraadt@

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Label windows which are smaller than expected with a reason.

* Restore change in r1.17 but add checks to prevent the line length overflowing, from Balazs Kezes.

* Do not put a space between status-left/status-right and the window list, instead move the space into the defaults for the options (so status-left now defaults to "[#S] ". From Balazs Kezes.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge linkw and movew which are virtually identical.

* Move cfg_causes local into cfg.c and remove struct causelist.

* Add pane_input_off format, from Anish R Athalye.

* Fix some spacing nits.

* Merge unlink-window into kill-window.

* Only redraw pane when it has actually changed.

* Save next item after firing command in case it has added to the queue.

* Merge branch 'master' of ssh://git.code.sf.net/p/tmux/tmux-code

* Move template defines back into .c files.

* Tidy up some includes.

* Move suspend-client code into detach-client.

* Argh, meant to remove this file...

* Move list-commands into list-keys.

* Missed a couple of cmd_entry struct members from previous.

* Instead of setting up the default keys by building the key struct directly with a helper function in the cmd_entry, include a table of bind-key commands and pass them through the command parser and a temporary cmd_q.

* Fix description of Ss and Se.

* Merge branch 'master' of ssh://git.code.sf.net/p/tmux/tmux-code

* OSdep:  Update for xrealloc() change

* Copy ACS characters as UTF-8, from Balazs Kezes.

* Merge branch 'master' of ssh://git.code.sf.net/p/tmux/tmux-code

* Fix osdep_get_cwd on Solaris 11, from J Raynor.

* Call waitpid on SIGCHLD even if client not attached, it is possible (on very slow platforms) for the first daemon() child to still be running when client_attached is set so we end up with a zombie. From J Raynor.

* Support using pane id as part of session or window specifier (so %1 means session-of-%1 or window-of-%1) and window id as part of session (so @1 means session-of-@1).

* Support ! for last pane.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Don't close random file descriptor on error, from J Raynor.

* I broke last change, fix so it works, from J Raynor.

* cdefs.h -> types.h.

* Solaris doesn't have flock and fcntl is useless so make a no-op flock. Reported by Dagobert Michelsen.

* Synchronize forkpty master and child to avoid hang on AIX with fast exiting child and output left in the queue, from J Raynor.

* Fix some comments (c -> colour) and join unnecessary line splits.

* Tweak www and add RELEASE variable for current release version so we don't need to turn it back and forth when updating.

* Stupid comment.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Remove support for the continuous reporting "any" mouse mode which never really worked properly and is rarely used.

* FAQ:  Mention Git before filing bug reports

* Revert the up/down wheel emulation for now, there will be a better way to do this along later for those who want it.

* lockf is entirely useless and it was a mistake to change to it, go back to using flock which actually works sensibly. Also always retry the lock to fix a potential race, and add some extra logging.

* Drop explicit support for F13-F20 and change to match the xterm terminfo entry:

* Show an error if cmd_find_session can't find the current session, like the other functions.

* An EOF is a good reason to close a connection.

* If a client is killed while suspended with ^Z so has gone through the MSG_EXITED dance, don't try to resume it since a) it's pointless and b) the tty structures have been cleaned up and tmux will crash.

* Track whether a process is a zombie or not yet fully built via flags PS_{ZOMBIE,EMBRYO} on the process instead of peeking into the process's thread data.  This eliminates the need for the thread-level SDEAD state.

* Handle escaped back slashes and missing new lines at end of line by using fparseln instead of reimplementing it on our own.

* Allow keys and send-keys to invisible panes, from saggy-kun at users dot sf dot net.

* Count mouse clicks correctly, from Balazs Kezes.

* Merge branch 'master' of ssh://git.code.sf.net/p/tmux/tmux-code

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Merge branch 'master' of ssh://git.code.sf.net/p/tmux/tmux-code

* Remove some done, tweak some others.

* Comment style nits.

* Make -S- and -E- mean the start and end to capture-pane to avoid having to faff around with huge numbers to get everything.

* Might as well still allow autoconf 2.59.

* Copy newline when at EOL in vi(1) mode, from Balazs Kezes.

* Reset the buttons when the wheel is used, from Balazs Kezes.

* Some terminals send spurious releases for mouse wheel in SGR mouse mode, this causes confusion when tmux uses SGR outside but the application inside tmux is using conventional xterm mouse reporting. So suppress obviously bad input. From Timothy Allen, SF bug 128.

* Merge branch 'master' of ssh://git.code.sf.net/p/tmux/tmux-code

* Build DEBUG with -O2 as well.

* Properly track switching G0 and G1 modes between US-ASCII and VT100 line drawing rather than just treating them as SO and SI.

* Reset properly when c0-change-trigger is increased from zero so panes don't get stuck.

* Handle the top bit of xterm(1)-style modifier keys, based on a diff from Balazs Kezes.

* Add some formats for pane bounds.

* Change key-table to mode-table to allow for some future work. From Keith Amling.

* Simplify copy lines, from Keith Amling.

* Now that cmdlists are reference counted, there is no need for two-step deletion via the dead_key_bindings tree. From Keith Amling.

* Don't allow multiple buffers with the same name, from Thomas Adam.

* Linux:  Add <time.h> to log.c

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* If multiple arguments are given to new-session, new-window, split-window, respawn-window or respawn-pane, pass them directly to execvp() to help avoid quoting problems. One argument still goes to "sh -c" like before. Requested by many over the years. Patch from J Raynor.

* Add a copy mode key binding to copy to a named buffer. From J Raynor.

* Add support for named buffers. If you don't name a buffer, things work much as before - buffers are automatically named "buffer0000", "buffer0001" and so on and ordered as a stack. Buffers can be named explicitly when creating ("loadb -b foo" etc) or renamed ("setb -b buffer0000 -n foo"). If buffers are named explicitly, they are not deleted when buffer-limit is reached. Diff from J Raynor.

* Just use char ** for argv like normal people, not char *const *.

* Send up and down keys for mouse wheel in alternate screen mode (when it normally does nothing), from Marcel Partap.

* Instead of forcing mouse scroll to 1 in choose mode, scale it down instead. Means modifier keys still increase the line count, just not as much. Based on a diff from Marcel Partap.

* Plug a memory leak, from J Raynor.

* Both the two previous ways of navigating panes by direction have irritating flaws:

* Handle colour 8 properly in the 256 colour palette, from Timothy Allen.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* fcntl.h is still needed here.

* Typo in previous:  $(srcdir)

* Makefile.am:  Honour $srcdir for mdoc2man.awk

* specifying ECHOCTL once is enough ok nicm@

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* There is no longer a need for a paste_stack struct or for global_buffers to be global. Move to paste.c.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Differentiate between linked and unlinked window closes and renames, like we already do for adds. From Andre Masella.

* Merge branch 'master' of ssh://git.code.sf.net/p/tmux/tmux-code

* If pgrp fails in osdep_get_cwd, try sid. Fixes eg cat foo|less. From Balazs Kezes.

* #nnT went away a while ago, remove a leftover from the manpage.

* Add some UTF-8 utility functions and use them to prevent the width limit on formats from splitting UTF-8 characters improperly.

* Some more long lines.

* Next up is 2.0 not 1.10.

* Only scroll by one line at a time in choose mode, lists are generally pretty small.

* Set PATH explicitly, either from client or session environment. Previously it came from the session environment. From J Raynor.

* Wrap some long lines.

* Don't limit the DCS buffer to 256 bytes, expand it as needed. Requested by Suraj Kurapati.

* Remove some unnecessary includes and fix a typo.

* Correct the dance to fix the active pane in join-pane by pulling the (right) code from break-pane and window_remove_pane into a helper function.

* Remove the "info" message mechanism, this was only used for about five mostly useless and annoying messages. Change those commands to silence on success like all the others. Still accept the -q command line flag and "quiet" server option for now.

* Extend the -q flag to set-option to suppress errors about unknown options - this will allow options to be removed more easily.

* Do not show the -fg, -bg and -attr options. If asked for one explicitly, show the equivalent -style option instead.

* Remove the monitor-content option and associated bits and bobs. It's never worked very well. If there is a big demand for it to return, will consider better ways to do it.

* Memory leak in error path and unnecessary assignment, from clang.

* Remove a leftover prototype and fix some spacing.

* Remove the choose-list command to prepare for some later choose-* work.

* Because we pass the file descriptor from client to server, tmux can't usefully work if stdin is /dev/tty. Complain about it more clearly.

* Merge branch 'master' of ssh://git.code.sf.net/p/tmux/tmux-code

* +.

* Don't leak socketpair file descriptors if fork fails. Spotted by Balazs Kezes.

* Don't blindly increase offsets by the return value of snprintf, if there wasn't enough space this will go off the end. Instead clamp to the available space. Fixes crash reported by Julien Rebetez.

* save-buffer needs to use O_TRUNC.

* Remove <vis.h>; not used on Linux.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Work out mouse scroll wheel effect when the mouse is first detected and store it in struct mouse_event, reduce the scroll size the 3 but allow shift to reduce it to 1 and meta and ctrl to multiply by 3 if the terminal supports them, also support wheel in choose mode. From Marcel Partap.

* A couple of trivial mouse-related style nits.

* Support UTF-8 with choose-buffer, from Kosuke ASAMI. Also make buffer_sample bigger to let it trim at window right edge.

* Use the same logic for bell with and without visual-bell, from Filip Moc.

* Do not replace ## with # in status_replace1 because it'll be done later by the format code.

* Remove LocalWords.

* pane_start_path has gone away.

* missed commit matching log.c

* Don't crash with a zero-length argument to setb, from J Raynor.

* Add setb -a to append and a copy mode append command, from J Raynor with minor changes.

* Make session_attached a count and add session_many_attached flag.

* Add start-of-list, end-of-list, top-line and bottom-line in choice mode, from madmaverick9 at roxxmail dot eu, similar diff a few days later from Marcel Partap.

* Having three *clock* files is ridiculous, remove clock.c.

* Don't write into buffer if no arguments, reported by Filipe Rosset.

* Change secondary device attributes response to \033[>84;0;0c which is unique for tmux.

* Don't crash with a zero-length argument to setb, from J Raynor.

* Merge branch 'master' of ssh://git.code.sf.net/p/tmux/tmux-code

* In four byte UTF-8 sequences, only three bits of the first byte should be used. Fix from Koga Osamu.

* Remove log_debug2 as well and simplify log.c.

* GRID_DEBUG is no longer needed.

* Remove unused log functions.

* Missing period.

* Use utempter to update utmp if it's around for configure, from madmaverick9 at roxxmail dot eu.

* Add to TODO.

* Change terminal-overrides to a server option (now that we have them), it doesn't make much sense as a session option.

* Go back to working on 1.10

* Update CHANGES and configure.ac for 1.9a release

* Merge branch 'master' of ssh://git.code.sf.net/p/tmux/tmux-code

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Leftovers from removing 88 colour support, from Theo Buehler.

* If the terminfo entry has colors#256, assume that setaf and setab work and use them for the 256 colour set. If the terminfo entry doesn't have colors#256 and the user gives -2 to the client, use a \033[38;5;Xm sequence as before. Should allow fbterm to work with it's weird setaf and setab.

* Make status-interval of zero work as indented.

* Style nit - no space between function name and bracket.

* Missing *.

* Do not need to call winlink_find_by_window, from Filip Moc.

* Check for NULL session and whatnot in status_replace, from Thomas Adam.

* Make C-j the same as C-m, from Simon Nicolussi.

* Avoid use of uninitialized variable, from Thomas Adam.

* The last fix to xterm keys meant that some keys such as \033OA were being wrongly treated as partial matches. So both check xterm keys after standard keys and only wildcard the minimum required ('1' to '8'). Problems reported by Ralf Horstmann and Tim van der Molen.

* Sort and organize option names in tmux.vim

* Sort and organize commands in tmux.vim

* Remove references to 88colour support

* Allow replacing each of the many sets of separate foo-{fg,bg,attr} options with a single foo-style option. For example:

* Remember the last active pane in the top-bottom or left-right cell so that it can be restored when moving back to that cell with selectp -L/-R/etc. From Suraj N Kurapati.

* Merge start-server into kill-server.

* Support paste key in copy mode input (for search etc). Also clamp length to screen width.

* Merge server-info into show-messages and remove some not useful output.

* Add AC_PROG_MKDIR_P.

* + to TODO.

* Do not permit periods in session names (colons are already banned). From J Raynor.

* Only exit copy mode at the bottom if no selection in progress, from Benoit Pierre.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Do not attempt to read .tmux.conf if we can't figure out a home directory, from Tiago Cunha.

* Couple of fixes from cppcheck via Tiago Cunha.

* Fix a memory/fd leak reported by Tiago Cunha.

* Similar to attach-session, make switch-client -t accept a window and pane. From Johannes Jakobsson.

* Allow attach-session -t to accept a window and pane to select them on attach. Based on a diff from J Raynor.

* Three small changes from Tiago Cunha:

* Style and comment fixes from Tiago Cunha.

* Simplify args_set, from Tiago Cunha.

* Handle empty current directory more gracefully.

* missing unsigned char casts areound tolower() ok nicm

* Include unistd.h as it is the standard location for getopt().

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* from nicm: : handle msgbuf_write() returning EAGAIN

* Support case insensitive searching in the same manner as emacs - all lowercase means case insensitive, any uppercase means case sensitive. From J Raynor.

* Correctly redraw the top two lines in copy mode when they are selected - the selection was being updated before the redraw so the markings were lost. Based on a fix from J Raynor.

* Key to swap to other end of selection (bound to o with vi keys), from J Raynor.

* Do not run any command line command from the client which starts the server until after the configuration file completes. This prevents it racing against run-shell or if-shell in .tmux.conf that run in the background.

* Don't turn on modifyOtherKeys by default, it is annoying if tmux is killed and it's left on and we can't turn it on and off like we do for attributes. It's not hard to enable in .Xresources or .Xdefaults anyway.

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* And get it right this time... don't leak if it is an empty string either.

* Bracket in the wrong place in description of c0-change-trigger.

* Fix leak in format_get_command.

* Remove the KERN_PROC_CWD the proc_current_path format (which is the only thing that uses it now).

* Use format_get_command() and some spacing tweaks.

* Pass -1 for cwd now not NULL.

* We accidentally haven't been using $TMUX to work out the session for a while and in fact it is less useful that using the client ttyname. So don't bother and don't pass it from the client. If we need it in future it is in c->environ.

* Remove now unused cmd_get_default_path.

* Don't boke when figuring out working directory from configuration file.

* Show session name in detached message. Requested by somebody a few months ago who didn't bother testing it. But it works for me anyway.

* Don't look at string[length - 1] if length == 0.

* Alter how tmux handles the working directory to internally use file descriptors rather than strings.

* Make tilde expansion in command strings work even if it isn't terminated by /.

* Remove CMD_SENDENVIRON.

* mouse-resize-pane: Only resize on border select

* Support -c for new-session, based on code from J Raynor.

* First period not last for host_short, from Michael Scholz.

* Remove the barely-used and unnecessary command check() function.

* Clear window->flags when clearing winlinks

* choose-tree: Reset top when toggling items

* Renumber windows: Lookup lastw via window not index

* Assign mouse x/y coords before checking them. When receiving mouse inputs, we should set the x/y coordinates earlier than we currently do, so that we aren't off-by-one in the case when the statusbar is at the top of the screen. By Thomas Adam.

* Accept multiple parameters to SM/RM/DECSET/DECRST, based on a diff from Hayaki Saito.

* Add automatic-rename-format option allowing automatic rename to use something other than pane_current_command.

* Allow nested format expansion.

* Add length limit operator for formats.

* Handle input mouse positions <33 (we already can generate them).

* Only include actual trailing spaces not unused cells with capturep -J, from George Nachman.

* Allow the file descriptor received from the client to be -1.

* Add formats for window flags.

* Missing space in refresh-client synopsis.

* Grouped sessions were being leaked on destroy, correctly free them.

* Make recalculate_sizes() handle an empty window with no active pane. This can happen when a window is in two sessions - it isn't destroyed immediately when the pane goes away but is left until the last session is destroyed. Fixes problems with grouped sessions reported by Daniel Ralston.

* Pass flags into cmdq_guard as an argument since sometimes cmdq->cmd can be NULL. Avoids crash when a command in a command client can't be parsed.

* Add openat() to compat.

* Pass -1 for cwd now not NULL.

* We accidentally haven't been using $TMUX to work out the session for a while and in fact it is less useful that using the client ttyname. So don't bother and don't pass it from the client. If we need it in future it is in c->environ.

* Don't look at string[length - 1] if length == 0.

* Alter how tmux handles the working directory to internally use file descriptors rather than strings.

* Make tilde expansion in command strings work even if it isn't terminated by /.

* Similarly for MSG_COMMAND - allow full imsg limit not arbitrary 2048.

* Instead of fixed size buffers for some messages, send only the string length.

* retcode -> retval for exit message.

* Merge IDENTIFY_* flags with CLIENT_* flags.

* Bump protocol version and add new message types.

* Remove CMD_SENDENVIRON.

* Change the default for the default-path option to ~. This is a quick change to turn off the KERN_PROC_CWD code which is unpredictable. Later it will go away and there may be other changes to how this works.

* Ignore .dirstamp files

* Check setupterm() in libtinfo also

* Don't add client formats when they are NULL.

* Missing space in refresh-client synopsis.

* Pass flags into cmdq_guard as an argument since sometimes cmdq->cmd can be NULL. Avoids crash when a command in a command client can't be parsed.

* Add destroy entry to TODO.

* use .Mt for email addresses; from Jan Stary <hans at stare dot cz>; ok jmc@

* Merge branch 'obsd-master'

* Add support for Cgywin, apparently it is enough just to open the tty again in the server and fd passing is not necessary. Needs some ifdefs unfortunately but no way around that and some of them can go next time we're willing to do a protocol bump. Patch from J Raynor jxraynor at gmail dot com.

* Use _XPG6 on Solaris with GCC because the headers are insane and don't like GCC with -std=gnu99 and _XPG4_2. We should not really be using _XPG* at all but there doesn't seem to be a magic define that says "give me the latest standard", and things are further confused by the CMSG_DATA check in configure.ac which sets _XOPEN_SOURCE _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED.

* Fix sscanf that was guaranteed to always fail.

* Make sure non-UTF8 mouse coordinates are kept to 8-bit values.

* Fix a typo that meant we did not reset the background colour when it was omitted in a 256-colour SGR ([48;5m). From Yusuke ENDOH.

* Send all three of stdin, stdout, stderr from the client to the server, so that commands can directly make use of them. This means that load-buffer and save-buffer can have "-" as the file to read from stdin or write to stdout.

* Store the current working directory in the session, change the default-path option to default to empty and make that mean that the stored session CWD is used.

* New option, detach-on-destroy, to set what happens to a client when the session it is attached to is destroyed. If on (the default), it is detached; if off, it is switched to the most recently active session.

* Use server_destroy_session() for kill-session.

* Setting the cmdlist pointer in the bind-key to NULL to prevent it being freed after the command is executing is bogus because it may still be needed if the same command is going to be executed again (for example if you "bind-key a bind-key b ...").

* Emulate il1, dl1, ich1 to run (albeit slowly) with vt100 feature set.

* Two new options, window-status-format and window-status-current-format, which allow the format of each window in the status line window list to be controlled using similar # sequences as status-left/right.

* tweak previous;

* Revert to xterm-keys off by default. It was on as an experiment to see if the option could be removed, but it affects vi, so we have to keep the option, and a conservative default is better.

* Tidy up by breaking the # replacement code into a separate function, also add a few comments.

* Support rxvt-style keys again, but this time: support all the variations, put them in as raw escape sequences rather than fiddling with the values from terminfo, put them /after/ the terminfo values so the latter take precedence.

* Rewrite a confusing loop when freeing the arg array on exit and move the check for argv being NULL, prompted by parfait via deraadt.

* Add an explicit zero-length check for UTF-8 input data, prompted by a report from parfait via deraadt.

* Free the pane bufferevent when the fd is closed (the signal could come before the error callback).

* Don't try enable/disable the event if the window pane is dead (fd == -1), as the event will have been freed.

* Clear to the end of the screen from the right starting point when drawing line-by-line (in panes or if ed not supported). Fixes problem spotted by Frank Terbeck.

* Old xterm F1-F4 are \033O_P not \033[O_P.

* Unused variable. Aargh.

* Switch the tty key tree over to an (unbalanced) ternary tree which allows partial matches to be done (they wait for further data or a timer to expire, like a naked escape).

* Working on 1.2.

* Use %%VERSION%% so the Makefile can replace it by VERSION.

* Update CHANGES, and NOTES for the 1.1 release.

* Bump VERSION.

* Prepare the tree for the 1.1 release.

* key_string_lookup_key uses a static buffer, so copy its output into the working buffer before calling the command print function which can also use it (eg send-keys).

* Key flags are only used for initialisation so they are not needed in the main tty_key struct.

* EVLOOP_ONCE takes care of the wakeup, so no need to call event_loopexit(NULL).

* Now all timers are events, there is no longer any need to wake up every 50 ms - only wake up when an event happens.

* Switch tty key input over to happen on a read event. This is a bit more complicated because of escape input, but in that case instead of processing a key immediately, schedule a timer and reprocess the bufer when it expires.

* Convert the key repeat timer to an event.

* Change window name change to use a timer event rather than a gettimeofday() check every loop.

* Move status timer check into the global once-per-second timer, this could maybe be done better but one every second is better than once every 50 ms.

* Use timeout events for the identify and message timers.

* Don't reenlist the client imsg event every loop, instead have a small function to it and call it after the event triggers or after a imsg is added.

* Ignore the colour on space, /not/ the attributes.

* Fix the reverse emulation when a terminal doesn't have setab to use the correct fg/bg (adjusted if spaces) and happen before attribute setting.

* Change declaration and use of malloc_options to be more standard, from Tim van der Molen.

* Don't backoff based on suspended or deda clients as they are always likely to have data backed up.

* Add an activity time for clients, like for sessions, and change session and client lookup to pick the most recently used rather than the most recently created - this is much more useful when used interactively and (because the activity time is set at creation) should have no effect on source-file.

* If it isn't available explicitly, work out the current client in a similar way to the current session - build a list of the possibilities then pick the newest.

* Change session and client activity and creation time members to have more meaningful names.

* tv member of struct paste_buffer is updated but not otherwise used, so remove it.

* When matching the session names with -t, look for exact matches first before trying partial matches.

* Leftover unused variable :-/.

* There isn't much point in doing lstat before connect so instead just do connect and handle ENOENT from it which is a little tidier.

* Reorder slightly to tidy code.

* Clear signal flags /before/ taking action and continue afterwards to reduce chance of dropping signals. Pointed out by deraadt@.

* Call fstat() after fopen() rather than stat() before.

* Reset the umask right after fopen to avoid leaving it changed on error, noticed by deraadt@.

* Use strlcpy instead of strncpy, pointed out by deraadt.

* Don't do anything in the client callback if the client has already died to avoid a use-after-free (the callback is used twice, once for the client itself and once for the tty). Fixes crashes seen by Han Boetes.

* Nuke accidentally-committed debugging statement.

* Not all terminals swap CSI and SS3 on ctrl, so remove that.

* Rewrite xterm-keys code (both input and output) so that works (doesn't always output the same modifiers, accepts all the possible input keys) and is more understandable.

* Support the (mostly new) function key+modifier caps (kIC-kIC7). Most of these will be caught (soon) by the xterm keys code in xterm itself but some other descriptions such as rxvt define them as well.

* Redraw checks have to after handling input or pane redraw flags set by key presses will not be acted on.

* The client buffers have to be checked after every event in order to catch the escape timers and properly reset the cursor.

* Split the server code handling clients, jobs and windows off into separate files from server.c (merging server-msg.c into the client file) and rather than iterating over each set after poll(), allow a callback to be specified when the fd is added and just walk once over the returned pollfds calling each callback where needed.

* Only redraw the pane when changing mode, not the entire window.

* Merge prepare_cmd into main as it is short and only called once.

* Tidy identify message send into a separate function.

* Don't try to unsuspend a client if it isn't suspended.

* Client tidying: get rid of client_ctx struct in favour of two variables in client.c, and move the functions in client-fn.c into other files.

* Unused variable.

* Remove unused function.

* Nuke dead store.

* Now we are correctly not redrawing the whole pane on linefeed, redo the last-cursor-position code to move to the right position when panes reach EOL.

* Tweak descriptions for up/down pane to be clearer.

* Don't redraw the scroll region on linefeed/reverse index unless it is necessary (the cursor is at the bottom/top). Should fix slow cursor movement when using vi in a pane spotted by pirofti@.

* Some terminals don't correctly clear their let's-wrap flag after changing the scroll region (which moves the cursor to 0,0). This means that if the cursor was at the edge of the screen, any further output after scroll region change incorrectly causes a line wrap. Add a workaround to move the cursor to position 0 if it is at the screen edge before changing scroll region.

* Always move the cursor position on !xenl terminals, since there is no invisible last cursor position.

* Don't print wide characters at screen width - 1. Matches uterm behaviour and is probably a better idea anyway.

* Instead of having a complicated check to see if the cursor is in the last position to avoid an explicit wrap, actually move it there.

* When checking whether the region will scroll and the cursor position is thus unsuitable for using CUD/CUU, check the current cursor position not the target position.

* Don't print exit messages when used as a login shell, requested by martynas@ a while back.

* Don't try to use \n across scroll region when doing \r\n either.

* When a session is unattached, reset its activity timer to prevent it locking instantly when reattached.

* Instead of using something sort of similar for both newline checks, use something the same. Doesn't fix the bug I'm looking for though :-/.

* +.

* When drawing lines that have wrapped naturally, don't force a newline but permit them to wrap naturally again. This allows terminals that use this to guess where lines start and end for eg mouse selecting (like xterm) to work correctly.

* When backspace is received at the beginning of a line and the previous line was wrapped, move the cursor back up to the end of the previous line.

* Don't run through the column unchanged case if the row was unchanged but there were no suitable optimisations, instead make it an else to fall through to absolute addressing.

* If the vertical cursor movement crosses the scroll region, CUU and CUD shouldn't be used even if VPA isn't present - in that case CUP should be used.

* Wrap a couple of long lines.

* Use absolute movement if right at the end of the line as it isn't a reliable place to move from relatively.

* Use relative cursor movement instead of absolute when possible and when supported by the terminal to reduce the size of the output data (generally about 10-20%).

* Permit attributes to be turned off in #[] by prefixing with "no", for example "noblink".

* Similarly add a tty_cursor_pane function to tidy up most of the calls.

* New option, mouse-select-pane. If on, the mouse may be used to select the current pane.

* There is no point setting the scroll region up for line feeds unless scrolling is actually going to happen, so don't.

* Add "grouped sessions" which have independent name, options, current window and so on but where the linked windows are synchronized (ie creating, killing windows and so on are mirrored between the sessions). A grouped session may be created by passing -t to new-session.

* Support for individual session idle time locking. May be enabled by turning off the lock-server option (it is on by default). When this is off, each session locks when it has been idle for the lock-after-time setting. When on, the entire server locks when ALL sessions have been idle for their individual lock-after-time settings.

* Don't die if the client is detaching (the tty has been closed) after waking up from locking.

* Remove the internal tmux locking and instead detach each client and run the command specified by a new option "lock-command" (by default "lock -np") in each client.

* Trim some code by moving the ioctl(TIOCGWINSZ) after SIGWINCH from the client into the server.

* Don't attempt to open() the tty path, rely on the client sending its stdin fd with imsg and fatal if it doesn't, then set the FD_CLOEXEC flag in tty_init instead of tty_open to prevent them leaking into child processes if any are created between the two calls.

* Tweak tparm() to make Solaris' backward userland happy and remove the -I mess in configure which tried to deal with the fallout from their horrible package management.

* When moving up or down in copy mode, save the cursor position and size of the last line with content (width != 0) and use it to determine if the cursor should be at the end of the line. Fixes problem of the cursor always jumping to the end of the line when scrolling past a blank line.

* Fix grid_expand_line so it actually works when the required size is bigger than 2 * the current size.

* A few trivial optimisations: no need to check for zero size if calling buffer_ensure in buffer.c; expand grid lines by a greater increase than one each time; and don't read UTF-8 data unless it actually needs to be checked when overwriting a cell.

* VTIME and VMIN are only necessary in noncanonical mode, so Solaris reuses the VEOF and VEOL indexes for them. ICANON is set by default, so don't bother to set VTIME and VMIN.

* Instead of just checking for an empty buffer, which may not be the case if there is unconsumed data, save the previous size and use it instead. This means that activity monitoring should work in this (unlikely) event.

* Whoops, getting the comparison the right way round is usually recommended.

* Move another expensive options test to after a cheaper timer check/update.

* options_get_number() is relatively expensive and a check for dead panes happens a lot more often than actually finding one, so instead of getting the option for every check, get it for every dead window found.

* Update.

* Now that pane targets (-t) are supported, switch some commands to use them where it makes sense: clock-mode, copy-mode, scroll-mode, send-keys, send-prefix.

* Tag a few missed printf-like functions and fix a missing "%s".

* Pass show-buffer output through vis(3) as well, and wrap it to the edge of the terminal when used from the command line.

* Change list-buffers to run the preview of the buffer through vis(1).

* Use the full screen width when printing output rather than one less.

* Nuke unnecessary assignment.

* Add a "delete line" key when editing in the status line or the search up/down prompt. C-u with emacs keys, d with vi.

* Add (naive) searching and goto line in copy mode. Searching is C-r and C-s with emacs keys, / and ? with vi; n repeats the search again with either key set. All searching wraps the top/bottom. Goto line is g for both emacs and vi.

* Switch the prompt code to return an empty string when the user enters no response and reserve NULL for an explicit cancel. Change all callbacks to treat them the same so no functional change.

* +.

* Add and remove some bits.

* vi(1)-style half page scroll in copy and scroll modes. Move the vi full page scroll key to C-b instead of C-u and use C-u/C-d for half page scrolling with vi keys. In emacs mode, half page scrolling is bound to M-Up and M-Down.

* Scroll by two less than the number of lines in the screen, like emacs, rather than by the entire screen, to make it easier to pull things out from under the line indicator. Suggested by claudio.

* Disable mode-mouse (mouse in copy/choice mode) by default as it isn't very useful at the moment and causes confusion.

* Add a base-index session option to specify the first index checked when looking for an index for a new window.

* Allowing copy mode to scroll left and right is annoying, so limit it to the real screen width. To indicate the cursor is at the end of the line rather than the cell before, put a '$' in the last cell.

* Rather than telling the client to exit in the function when creating a new session detached, let the caller do it. Allows "tmux new -d \; attach" to work.

* When creating a new session from the command-line where there is an external terminal, copy the termios(4) special characters and use them for new windows created in the new session. Suggested by Theo.

* Redraw the screen after resizing.

* It was originally intended that scroll mode would show content that was currently off-screen due to resize, but somewhere along the way this got lost. Restore this behaviour to scroll mode by fixing screen_write_copy to read up to the saved line length rather than the current screen width. Copy mode remains unaltered for now.

* If the client passes zero for the window size in the identify message (which it can, for example on serial terminals), reset it to 80x25, same as for resize messages. Problem reported by kettenis@.

* A tty context must not be modified as it may be reused to update multiple clients, so make it const.

* When started as the shell, __progname contains a leading -, so hardcode "tmux" for socket path and log files, and strip it when working out the shell.

* imsg closes the fd after sending, so dup() STDIN_FILENO before passing it to the parent, otherwise TIOCGWINSZ will fail when the window is resized (that could actually be moved into the server but this is more future-proof and avoids breaking the protocol).

* Initialise log_fd to -1, prevents spurious disconnection of the client when it ends up as fd 0 (likely if the server is started with "tmux start").

* Have the client pass its stdin fd to the server when identifying itself and have the server use that rather than reopening the tty. If the fd isn't given, use the old behaviour (so no need for a version change).

* Add a TTY_OPENED flag and tidy a little.

* Drop the no_stop argument to tty_close and tty_free in favour of a flag in the tty struct.

* Switch tmux to use imsg. This is the last major change to make the client-server protocol more resilient and make the protocol versioning work properly. In future, the only things requiring a protocol version bump will be changes in the message structs, and (when both client and server have this change) mixing different versions should nicely report an error message.

* Change the way the grid is stored, previously it was:

* If there is an error in the configuration file, don't just exit(1) as this can cause the client to hang. Instead, send the error message, then mark the client as bad and start a normal shutdown so the server exits once the error is written.

* Move introduction section up into description. From jmc.

* This file is not kept up to date and too many people are using it as-is then finding tmux key bindings missing. Trim it down and make it clear this is an example only.

* Using the alternative screen (smcup/rmcup) should also preserve the current colours and attributes. Found thanks to a report from Taylor Venable.

* There aren't many client message types or code to handle them so get rid of the lookup table and use a switch, merge the tiny handler functions into it, and move the whole lot to client.c.

* Tell the server when the client gets SIGTERM so it can clean up the terminal properly, rather than just exiting.

* Merge pane number into the target specification for pane commands. Instead of using -p index, a target pane is now addressed with the normal -t window form but suffixed with a period and a pane index, for example :0.2 or mysess:mywin.1. An unadorned number such as -t 1 is tried as a pane index in the current window, if that fails the same rules are followed as for a target window and the current pane in that window used.

* new sentence, new line;

* Add a mode-mouse option to prevent tmux taking over the mouse in choice or copy modes.

* Add an additional heuristic to work out the current session when run from the command line. The name of all slave ptys in the server is known, so if the client was run on a tty, look for any sessions containing that tty and use the most recently created.

* Rename struct hdrtype to msgtype which is a better name and can be used even when struct hdr disappears.

* If select-layout is not given an argument, repply the last layout used in the window, if any.

* Remove an unused entry in the mode keys command enum and rename MODEKEYCOPY_QUIT to _CANCEL to match the others.

* Change mode key bindings from big switches into a set of tables. Rather than lumping them all together, split editing keys from those used in choice/more mode and those for copy/scroll mode.

* Get rid of empty mode_key_free function.

* Add a key to delete to end of line at the prompt (^K in emacs mode, C/D in vi).

* Detect backspace by looking at termios VERASE and translate it into \177 (which matches screen's behaviour if not its termcap/terminfo entry). The terminfo kbs cap is often wrong or missing so it can't be used, and just assuming \177 may be wrong.

* Calculate the space available for the prompt buffer and the cursor position correctly, and make it work when the screen is not wide enough.

* Make some functions which return unused values void (mostly found by lint) and tweak a redundant expression in window_pane_set_mode.

* Nix a few unused attributes on arguments which are no longer unused.

* Remove a couple of unused functions and fix a type ("FALLTHOUGH"), found by lint.

* __progname is not const, pointed out by deraadt.

* Tidy up keys: use an enum for the key codes, and remove the macros which just wrap flag sets/clears/tests.

* Sync OpenBSD patchset 150:

* Include .depend in GNUmakefile since GNU make does not include it automatically.

* No paths.h in cmd.c; add _PATH_DEV for Solaris.

* Update.

* Now that #P could be in the status line, flag it for redraw when the active pane changes.

* Display the number of failed password attempts (if any) when the server is locked. From Tom Doherty.

* Add a status-justify option to allow the window list in the status line to be positioned at the left, centre, or right.

* New options, window-status-current-{fg,bg,attr}, to set the fg, bg and attributes with which the current window is shown in the status line. From Johan Friis, thanks.

* Kill some dead stores and fix a null pointer deref, found by clang.

* Move the offsets as well when swapping panes.

* With gcc4, turn off unnecessart pointer sign warnings.

* Add three new session options: visual-activity, visual-bell, visual-content. If these are enabled (and the monitor-activity, bell-action and monitor-content options are configurated appropriately), when activity, a bell, or content is detected, a message is shown.

* tweak previous;

* Change a couple of screenshots which had screen in them now I've got rid of screen on that box too :-).

* Improved layout code.

* Add a -k flag to unlink-window which makes it behave the same as the old kill-window - if a window is linked into only one session it unlinked and destroyed.

* Add three new session options: visual-activity, visual-bell, visual-content. If these are enabled (and the monitor-activity, bell-actio and monitor-content options are configurated appropriately), when activity, a bell, or content is detected, a message is shown.

* Make it so using kill-pane to destroy the last pane in a window destroys the window instead of being an error.

* When resizing a screen smaller in alternate screen mode, all the lines needed could be consumed by deleting from the bottom, leaving none to be removed from the top. In this case, don't call grid_view_delete_lines with ny of 0 as this is incorrect and causes a bounds check to fatal error if built with -DDEBUG.

* Tidy up new-session and attach-session and change them to work from inside tmux, switching the current client to the new or requested session.

* Remove a duplicate key binding, and turn off autorepeat for up/down as it is kind of annoying by default.

* If -u is specified or UTF-8 is otherwise detected when the server is started, enable the utf8 and status-utf8 optons. While here, note in the man page that the server is started with the first session and exits when none remain.

* Make it so using kill-pane to destroy the last pane in a window destroys the window instead of being an error.

* - New command display-message (alias display) to display a message in the   status line (bound to "i" and displays the current window and time by   default). The same substitutions are applied as for status-left/right. - Add support for including the window index (#I), pane index (#P) and window   name (#W) in the message, and status-left or status-right. - Bump protocol version.

* When resizing a screen smaller in alternate screen mode, all the lines needed could be consumed by deleting from the bottom, leaving none to be removed from the top. In this case, don't call grid_view_delete_lines with ny of 0 as this is incorrect and causes a bounds check to fatal error if built with -DDEBUG.

* Update TODO.

* Changed the wrong thing here.

* Tidy up new-session and attach-session and change them to work from inside tmux, switching the current client to the new or requested session.

* Remove a duplicate key binding, and turn off autorepeat for up/down as it is kind of annoying by default.

* If -u is specified or UTF-8 is otherwise detected when the server is started, enable the utf8 and status-utf8 optons. While here, note in the man page that the server is started with the first session and exits when none remain.

* Stupid cvsps.

* A similar for fix for window_choose: don't rely on the callback always being called to free data, have a separate free callback and call it from the mode cleanup code.

* Oops, it is always a good idea to get arguments the right way round.

* Memory could be leaked if a second prompt or message appeared while another was still present, so add a separate prompt free callback and make the _clear function responsible for calling it if necessary (rather than the individual

* Remove some duplicate code that was causing the status line to be redrawn even when it hadn't changed.

* Fix arguments to switch-client.

* Typo in grid_duplicate_lines (sy for dy) causing it to write into the wrong place when copying UTF-8 data. Found by Dan Colish.

* Improved NetBSD current-process detection from Roy Marples.

* Make status_message_set a variadic printf-like function. No functional change - helpful for a couple of things coming soon.

* Return -1 not NULL on error, pointed out by Roy Marples.

* Add a -k flag to unlink-window which makes it behave the same as the old kill-window - if a window is linked into only one session it unlinked and destroyed.

* The man page says that kill-window removes the window entirely, unlinking it from any sessions. In fact the implementation only affected the current session, making it the same as unlink-window but destroying the window if it was linked into only one session (unlinkw gives an error). Change the behaviour to match what it documented and was originally intended.

* Having to update NSETOPTION/NSETWINDOWOPTION when adding new options is a bit annoying and it is only use for iterating, so use a sentinel to mark the end of each array instead. Different fix for a problem pointed out by Kalle Olavi Niemitalo.

* Add main-pane-height to the options list (was missed before).

* For some reason when clearing status/message it was redrawing the entire client not just the status line. Changing this also revealed the check for the status line was incorrect when drawing the pane.

* Instead of faking up a status line in status_redraw, use the same code to redraw it as to draw the entire screen, just skip all lines but the last.

* Don't accept input to a window if it not visible.

* The scroll region cannot be one line only, ignore attempts to make it so.

* Get rid of the PANE_HIDDEN flag in favour of a function, and moving the decision for whether or not a pane should be drawn out of the layout code and into the redraw code.

* Need time.h not sys/time.h for time(2).

* Need time.h not sys/time.h for time(2).

* Add backspace key to named keys.

* Whoops, chose the wrong one in a conflict. Revert.

* arg.c is no longer required.

* Don't need ncurses, use curses.

* Having fixed flags for single-character getopt options is a bit hard to maintain and is only going to get worse as more are used. So instead, add a new uint64_t member to cmd_entry which is a bitmask of upper and lowercase options accepted by the command.

* copy-mode and scroll-mode have a -u flag missing from usage, add it.

* Tidy up and improve target (-t) argument parsing:

* Support "alternate screen" mode (terminfo smcup/rmcup) typically used by full screen interactive programs to preserve the screen contents. When activated, it saves a copy of the visible grid and disables scrolling into and resizing out of the history; when deactivated the visible data is restored and the history reenabled.

* Missed this declaration in key bindings change. Whoops.

* Document the -k flag to new-window.

* Add a "back to indentation" key in copy mode to move the cursor to the first non-whitespace character. ^ with vi and M-m with emacs key bindings. Another from Kalle Olavi Niemitalo, thanks.

* Merge three copies of identical code to move the cursor x position into a single function, from Kalle Olavi Niemitalo.

* If it exist, load a system-wide configuration file /etc/tmux.conf before any user-specified one.

* Since tmux doesn't actually need ncurses, use -lcurses/curses.h instead. Pointed out by millert a while ago.

* Having fixed flags for single-character getopt options is a bit hard to maintain and is only going to get worse as more are used. So instead, add a new uint64_t member to cmd_entry which is a bitmask of upper and lowercase options accepted by the command.

* Update TODO.

* Missed this declaration in key bindings change. Whoops.

* Document the -k flag to new-window.

* Creating a key binding which replaces itself (such as "bind x bind x lsw") frees the command list bound to the key while it is still being executed, leading to a use after free. To prevent this, create a dead keys list and defer freeing replaced or removed key bindings until the main loop when the key binding will have finished executing.

* Limit the history to hlimit not hlimit - 1. This makes a history-limit setting of 0 work as expected.

* Add -r to the synopsis of the paste-buffer command, prompted by jmc.

* When pasting, translate \n into \r. This matches xterm and putty's behaviour, and makes emacs happy when pasting into some modes. A new -r (raw) flag to paste-buffer pastes without the translation.

* Copy was using the real line length which after resize can be larger than the screen width. When built with -DDEBUG, this made the grid bounds checking code kill the server. Restrict copying to the actual width.

* paste-buffer -d was not documented. From Kalle Olavi Niemitalo.

* Redraw the status line after renaming a session (it may contain the name).

* Don't send initialisation strings is1/2/3 (barely anything else does) and move smcup to the first and rmcup to the last sequences output to the terminal. This allows tmux to use the alternate screen (smcup/rmcup) when available.

* Add a default-terminal option to set the starting value of $TERM in new windows.

* Document display-time option which seems to have been missed.

* When the terminal size is reduced horizontally, don't truncate lines to the new width, so that if the same lines are later increased in size the content reappears.

* Stop in the right place so all the lines selected are copied. Reported by Kalle Olavi Niemitalo, thanks.

* Fix $Id$.

* New command, if-shell (alias if). Executes the tmux command in the second argument if the shell command in the first succeeds, for example:

* Fix $Id$.

* Cursor up and down should be limited by the scroll region (cuu should stop at the scroll region top if starting from below it and cud stop at the bottom if starting from above). Fixes another vttest test.

* Don't leak FILE * on malloc failure. From ivoire at users dot sourceforge dot net.

* Change inserting and deleting lines inside the scroll region to properly clear lines that should be inserted/deleted but not moved. Fixes problems with mutt reported by Brian Lewis, thanks.

* Tidy by removing unused argument from grid_view_{insert,delete}_line_region functions (currently don't fully work, this is to make fix easier).

* Fix two memory leaks when assigning shell variables in configuration file/command prompt. From Tiago Cunha.

* Accidently deleted default-command.

* Bring spacing into line.

* Whoops, that shouldn't have been there.

* Fix $Id$.

* When reinitialising the screen, do not omit to clear the last line.

* Don't let ambiguous commands override an exact alias match: eg if commands "abc-1", "abc-2", "abc-3" exist and "abc-3" has the alias "abc", "tmux abc" should execute abc-3, not complain about the command being ambiguous.

* Rename the global options variables to be shorter and to make session options clear. No functional change, getting this out of the way to make later options changes easier.

* Handle empty or unset TERM correctly; also fix a fatal() message while here.

* When sending a "protocol mismatch" error message, tell the client to exit afterwards, otherwise it hangs.

* The fix for default-path (use target session options instead of global options) is required here as well, doh.

* Minor fix: look for default-path in the options for the specified session first rather than just the global options. From Brandon Mercer, thanks.

* Add a section summarising how options work, make the distinction between window and session options clearer, and fix the incorrect synopses and descriptions of show-options and show-window-options.

* When unlocking the server, don't try to clear the prompt on clients without a prompt (such as the one issuing the unlock request).

* Fix two memory leaks when assigning shell variables in configuration file/command prompt. From Tiago Cunha.

* When reinitialising the screen, do not omit to clear the last line.

* Just appending -l to $SHELL to create a login shell is wrong: -l is not POSIX, and some people may use shells which do not support it. Instead, make an empty default-command option mean a login shell, and fork it with a - in argv[0] which is the method used by login(1).

* Sync.

* This is not really important or major.

* Next will be 1.0.

* If using the default login shell (empty default-command), strip any - prefix.

* Change default_window_name to use window_default_command if the actual cmd is empty. From Josh Elsasser.

* Fix two copy/paste bugs: forbid zero-length buffers to prevent a fatal error when trying to paste them, found by me, and miscalculation of the start/end causing random fatal errors when copying in copy-mode, reported by sthen.

* Update.

* Solaris has no strcasestr.

* Don't see a reason for sys/cdefs.h here; remove it.

* $Id$.

* Move defines after includes to avoid multiple definition.

* Typo: bsdpoll.h -> bsd-poll.h.

* Change >| to rm/> as apparently Solaris /bin/sh doesn't like it.

* Try to make a bit more sense here.

* Comment FDEBUG and bump dist version.

* Changes for 0.9.

* Update with new UTF-8 environment variable information for 0.9.

* Using -l to specify a login shell is non-POSIX and causes problems with shells that do not support it. Instead, set an empty default-command to invoke $SHELL with - prefixed to argv[0], and make this the default setting.

* This file is not going to be used as much any longer, make a note.

* Update ready for 0.9

* When unlocking the server, don't try to clear the prompt on clients without a prompt (such as the one issuing the unlock request).

* Fix two errors with character/line insertion and deletion: the maximum number of characters which may be inserted or deleted is the screen width, not one less (and similarly for lines and height); and if characters or lines are deleted by moving the ones that follow, the space at the end needs to be cleared.

* $Id$.

* When unlocking the server, don't try to clear the prompt on clients without a prompt (such as the one issuing the unlock request).

* Fix $Id$.

* Don't try to page up with scroll-mode -u or copy-mode -u unless the mode was successfully changed - if already in a different mode, it would corrupt the mode data.

* Use gmtime_r so the current time isn't overwritten, the minute comparison works and the clock is actually updated. It was already used for lock-server but not here.

* Copy the 256-colour flag into the tty saved cell as well as the actual colour, otherwise colour 8 isn't reset.

* Add missing spaces before some alias closing brackets, otherwise they are shown in the wrong style.

* Add missing spaces before some alias closing brackets, otherwise they are shown in the wrong style.

* Whoops, revert.

* Remove some unused function declarations; no binary change.

* After logging (if enabled) is switched to file, there is no reason to keep stdin/stdout/stderr active, so dup them to /dev/null.

* After logging (if enabled) is switched to file, there is no reason to keep stdin/stdout/stderr active, so dup them to /dev/null.

* Remove some unused function declarations; no binary change.

* Set LC_ALL=C to stop i18n breaking gcc test.

* Apparently NetBSD's tcgetpgrp is good enough to use, so don't need to play complicated games, from Roy Marples.

* Status line fixes: don't truncate status-right now the length calculation is done for UTF-8, limit to the maximum length correctly when printing, and always print a space even if the left string is longer than the width available.

* Remove some dead assignments, found by sthen with clang.

* #ifndef nitems.

* Status line fixes: don't truncate status-right now the length calculation is done for UTF-8, limit to the maximum length correctly when printing, and always print a space even if the left string is longer than the width available.

* Also #ifndef nitems here, caught by Thomas Jeunet.

* Remove some dead assignments, found by sthen with clang.

* #ifndef nitems to avoid redefining it if it is already in a header.

* Update TODO.

* vis compat stuff.

* Start of portability update: bitstring.h.

* Lose -V.

* Skip 8 line diffs ($Id$ change only).

* Comparison script.

* libgen.h.

* More diff-to-OpenBSD reduction. Move a lot of compat stuff into compat.h.

* Whitespace and more syncing.

* Don't need linker magic anymore.

* No more xmalloc-debug.

* Fix rejects.

* Sync this properly.

* Restore $Id$ and add script to do so.

* If getcwd() fails, use the user's home directory, or /, instead of failing with an error.

* lines variable can be -1 (to be ignored), so should be signed. Found by lint.

* Remove error about using -L and -S together which was never displayed as logging wasn't yet enabled, was unnecessary, and contradicted the man page which says using -S will cause -L to be ignored.

* tmux doesn't and won't need syslog logging, so remove it and some other unused functions found by lint.

* Miscellaneous unused functions, including one which was basically a duplicate. Found by lint.

* Nuke unused buffer functions. Found by lint.

* Unused prototypes. Found by lint, no binary change.

* Unused variables. Found by lint, no binary change.

* Now that a UTF-8-capable puts function exists, use it for printing strings in choice/more modes - lines with UTF-8 now display properly in find-window results.

* Fix a type mismatch warning in assignment.

* Change find-window and monitor-content to use fnmatch(3). For convenience and compatibility, *s are implicitly added at the start and end of the pattern.

* Add a dedicated function to convert a line into a string and use it to simplify the search window function.

* Change to match xterm's resizing behaviour, including pushing lines into the history from the top when reducing vertical size and pulling them again when increasing size.

* Make remain-on-exit work again when there is only one pane left, which was broken sometime during the pane/layout changes. Reported/tested by Iain Morgan, thanks.

* Trying to predict the cursor position for UTF-8 output in the same way as for normal eight-bit output is wrong, separate it into a different function. Fixes spacing when mixing UTF-8 with some escape sequences, notably the way w3m does it.

* Constify utf8_width() function argument.

* If a pane is "zombified" (remain-on-exit flag), don't continue to queue key and mouse input for it (otherwise they are processed after respawn).

* LC_ALL overrides LC_CTYPE and LANG. Comment was correct but the code wrong. Pointed out by Hannah Schroeter, thanks.

* Terminate cwd buffer before running xstrdup on it.

* Check the first of LC_CTYPE, LC_ALL and LANG, rather than just the last, when trying to decide about UTF-8, and use strcasestr. Reported by Geert Hendrickx.

* strdup the input to putenv to avoid in one case passing a string that is later freed and in the other const strings.

* Call setproctitle earlier in the client, and include the socket name. Makes it easier to match client to server in ps/pgrep when using several servers.

* Print a better message than '(null)' if no command is specified ("tmux \;").

* Zero the password given to -U in the client as well.

* If the prompt is hidden or a password is sent with -U, zero it before freeing it.

* Implement the CBT (backward tab) sequence (\033[Z).

* Proper support for tab stops (\033H etc), using a bitstring(3). Makes another vttest test happy.

* Okay, so I screwed up when testing this, doh. Unbreak so that CAN/SUB actually do cancel the sequence, and tweak to make the code more clear.

* Oops, CAN and SUB should abort the sequence (return to first state), not remain in the same state.

* More input compatibility love. Support C0 within escape sequences, and the C0 control character VT (vertical tab, \013), which is treated as LF like VT102. Makes another vttest happy.

* Support insert mode by using insert character to shift the cells before writing as normal.

* Implement the DEC alignment test. With the last change this is enough for the first cursor test in vttest (in ports) to pass; it still shops a few more problems though.

* Fix some miscalculations when clearing to start of screen: the number of lines to the cursor is cy not cy - 1, and the current cursor cell should be included.

* Use vis(3) instead of handrolled function.

* Pass window titles through vis(1). <0x20 is dropped anyway by the input state machine but top-bit-set nonprintables could cause trouble, and they are neater like this anyway.

* Do not set the window title by default (make set-titles option default to off), wiping over the title is rude and annoying.

* New session option, status-utf8, to control the interpretation of top-bit-set characters in status-left and status-right (if on, they are treated as UTF-8; otherwise passed through).

* Add a UTF-8 aware string length function and make UTF-8 in status-left/status-right work properly. At the moment any top-bit-set characters are assumed to be UTF-8: a status-utf8 option to configure this will come shortly.

* Nuke unused pane flag.

* Cast char to u_char before passing to isalnum(). By ray

* remove unused flag; while here, make usage's output fit on 80-column displays.

* Use login shells by default.

* Don't leak memory if multiple -f flags are given. From ray

* Sync man page with OpenBSD.

* Add missing -a flag.

* When swapping pane positions, swap the PANE_HIDDEN flag as well, otherwise tmux crashes when trying to find the new active pane.

* Sync to OpenBSD: fixes from ray@.

* Use the pane flags not the window flags. Doh.

* diagflags for diags okay nicm@

* If getcwd() fails, use the user's home directory, or /, instead of failing with an error.

* lines variable can be -1 (to be ignored), so should be signed. Found by lint.

* Now that a UTF-8-capable puts function exists, use it for printing strings in choice/more modes - lines with UTF-8 now display properly in find-window results.

* Fix a type mismatch warning in assignment.

* Change find-window and monitor-content to use fnmatch(3). For convenience and compatibility, *s are implicitly added at the start and end of the pattern.

* Add a dedicated function to convert a line into a string and use it to simplify the search window function.

* Change to match xterm's resizing behaviour, including pushing lines into the history from the top when reducing vertical size and pulling them again when increasing size.

* Make remain-on-exit work again when there is only one pane left, which was broken sometime during the pane/layout changes. Reported/tested by Iain Morgan, thanks.

* UTF-8 detection is broken on sparc64; disable until I get time to test it further.

* Trying to predict the cursor position for UTF-8 output in the same way as for normal eight-bit output is wrong, separate it into a different function. Fixes spacing when mixing UTF-8 with some escape sequences, notably the way w3m does it.

* tweak previous;

* Constify utf8_width() function argument.

* Mention LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE.

* Add some common config file examples to the quick start section.

* If a pane is "zombified" (remain-on-exit flag), don't continue to queue key and mouse input for it (otherwise they are processed after respawn).

* LC_ALL overrides LC_CTYPE and LANG. Comment was correct but the code wrong. Pointed out by Hannah Schroeter, thanks.

* Terminate cwd buffer before running xstrdup on it.

* Check the first of LC_CTYPE, LC_ALL and LANG, rather than just the last, when trying to decide about UTF-8, and use strcasestr. Reported by Geert Hendrickx.

* strdup the input to putenv to avoid in one case passing a string that is later freed and in the other const strings.

* Call setproctitle earlier in the client, and include the socket name. Makes it easier to match client to server in ps/pgrep when using several servers.

* Remove trailing newlines, spaces, and tabs.

* Print a better message than '(null)' if no command is specified ("tmux \;").

* Zero the password given to -U in the client as well.

* If the prompt is hidden or a password is sent with -U, zero it before freeing it.

* Implement the CBT (backward tab) sequence (\033[Z).

* Proper support for tab stops (\033H etc), using a bitstring(3). Makes another vttest test happy.

* Okay, so I screwed up when testing this, doh. Unbreak so that CAN/SUB actually do cancel the sequence, and tweak to make the code more clear.

* Oops, CAN and SUB should abort the sequence (return to first state), not remain in the same state.

* More input compatibility love. Support C0 within escape sequences, and the C0 control character VT (vertical tab, \013), which is treated as LF like VT102. Makes another vttest happy.

* zap trailing whitespace;

* Support insert mode by using insert character to shift the cells before writing as normal.

* Implement the DEC alignment test. With the last change this is enough for the first cursor test in vttest (in ports) to pass; it still shops a few more problems though.

* Fix some miscalculations when clearing to start of screen: the number of lines to the cursor is cy not cy - 1, and the current cursor cell should be included.

* Use vis(3) instead of handrolled function.

* Pass window titles through vis(1). <0x20 is dropped anyway by the input state machine but top-bit-set nonprintables could cause trouble, and they are neater like this anyway.

* Sync with private copy.

* Do not set the window title by default (make set-titles option default to off), wiping over the title is rude and annoying. Agreed by several.

* New session option, status-utf8, to control the interpretation of top-bit-set characters in status-left and status-right (if on, they are treated as UTF-8; otherwise passed through).

* Add a UTF-8 aware string length function and make UTF-8 in status-left/status-right work properly. At the moment any top-bit-set characters are assumed to be UTF-8: a status-utf8 option to configure this will come shortly.

* Add missing documentation for the -a flag used to move to next/previous window with alert.

* Add a section summarising the status line. There are quite a number of status line options, it is something many want to configure, and the meaning of some bits weren't really documented.

* undo a mistake found by sobrado;

* When swapping pane positions, swap the PANE_HIDDEN flag as well, otherwise tmux crashes when trying to find the new active pane.

* some cleanup; ok nicm

* Cast char to u_char before passing to isalnum().

* Recent code to try and detect if a terminal supports UTF-8 by printing to it fails spectacularly on (at least) sparc64, so disable it for now. Thanks to naddy and Josh Elsasser for help and testing.

* remove unused flag; while here, make usage's output fit on 80-column displays.

* sort options alphabetically.

* spawn login shells by default, adapt manpage bits as well. ok nicm@

* Don't access array[-1] if array is an empty string.

* Make code clearer: -       if (hdr->size > SIZE_MAX - 1) +       if (hdr->size == SIZE_MAX)

* Don't dereference NULL if buf winds up being empty. Can't happen right now according to NicM but better safe than sorry.

* Don't leak memory if multiple -f flags are given.

* Update the man page with some recent changes to the code:

* Whoops, didn't mean to add this.

* Import tmux, a terminal multiplexor allowing (among other things) a single terminal to be switched between several different windows and programs displayed on one terminal be detached from one terminal and moved to another.

* endpwent() is not required after getpwuid().

* +.

* Clear status line on incorrect password.

* Don't show real character under cursor when hidden. Doh.

* Reset activity time to avoid relock on -U.

* Now in base.

* Spacing.

* Update.

* Spacing.

* UPPER -> BIG, sort, and bump protocol version.

* stat(2) files before trying to load them to avoid problems, for example with "source-file /dev/zero".

* new layout plan

* Indentation.

* +.

* Try to guess if the window is UTF-8 by outputting a three-byte UTF-8 wide character and seeing how much the cursor moves. Currently tries to figure out if this works by some stupid checks on the terminal, these need to be rethought. Also might be better using a width 1 character rather than width 2.

* If LANG contains "UTF-8", assume the terminal supports UTF-8, on the grounds that anyone who configures it probably wants UTF-8. Not certain if this is a perfect idea but let's see if it causes any problems.

* - New window option monitor-content to search for a string in a window, and   highlight the status line if it matches. - To make this possible, the function cmd_find_window_search from   cmd-find-window.c had to be moved to window.c and renamed window_pane_search. - While there use three new functions in server.c to check for bell, activity,   and content, to avoid too much nesting.

* Note.

* (void).

* main-horizontal layout and main-pane-height option to match vertical.

* left-vertical -> main-vertical. Also update CHANGES/TODO.

* New option main-pane-width to set width of pane in left-vertical mode.

* manual -> manual-vertical.

* horizontal -> h, vertical -> v, to shorten some function names a little.

* Behave properly when resize not supported.

* Update TODO.

* manual -> manual-vertical.

* Clean up manual layout code:

* Fix comment.

* #undef everything in config.h. This is the only bit of the scripting work I am using now :-).

* +b on fopen.

* chmod +x configure

* Move some crap into the attic, and some other stuff into tools/.

* Move website stuff into its own directory.

* Move dist.mk to tools/.

* Use >|.

* Use a better variable name and allow the uname to be overridden.

* clean-all.

* clean-all target to clean configure stuff too.

* Use empty(), FreeBSD doesn't like ==.

* select-layout command and some key bindings.

* Recreate server socket on SIGUSR1, per SF feature request 2792533.

* putenv can be char *.

* Don't use -Wcast-qual and use explicit casts to shut gcc up in the few cases we can't avoid using a char *.

* +sfw for solaris too.

* Keys in status line (p in vi mode, M-y in emacs) to paste the first line of the upper paste buffer. Suggested by Dan Colish.

* Separate tmux target. Doh.

* PuTTY resizing from merdely.

* clear-history command.

* This is okay.

* Don't force wrapping with \n when asked, let the cursor code figure it out. Should fix terminals which use this to detect line breaks.

* It is HAVE_PTY_H, also add a cast to shut gcc up.

* HAVE_.

* Needs a VERSION.

* SunOS tweaks.

* +.

* Add distribution stuff back in.

* NetBSD has no strtonum so needs compat/.

* NetBSD tree.h has no RB_PREV.

* Use a variable for uname.

* print is redundant. Doh.

* Sprinkle the magic anti-GCC-suckage for *BSD as well.

* Move -lutil.

* Use the right osdep.

* install depends on all.

* Try to figure out if we are using gcc 4 and get rid of the stupid warning, while not breaking 3.x and 2.x...

* compat/bsd-poll.h now we are not doing -Icompat.

* Sort.

* Don't bother with this.

* Whoops, don't use the name of the rule here now.

* Add a changes entry.

* Two more to ignore.

* $(PROG) is gorn.

* cmake build files. I wrote these but then decided to keep the cleanup (getopt/HAVE_*) changes but add a manual configure script and clean up the makefiles instead. Can always be resurrected if necessary.

* Everything supported has working vsnprintf.

* Rename all feature flags to HAVE_* and move out of makefiles into a configure script which must be run before building.

* Bye-bye nonworking IRIX, can be rescued from the attic if ever needed again.

* Use getopt.c from openssh rather than OpenBSD's getopt_long.

* Bye-bye META.

* Works fine, escaping was the issue.

* Spacing.

* RB_INSERT returns &item if already exists, so use that rather than doing a check beforehand.

* Space trimmage mega-diff.

* This should be fixed by previous commit.

* Region can reset cursor to 0,0 - bad if there is an offset. So sort out region before cursor.

* Use ACS for line drawing characters.

* Only worry about complete seconds for status line update. Also reduce poll interval and de-magic-number it.

* Support "neww; neww" as well "neww ; neww".

* previous-layout command.

* Use a (pre)randomised binary tree for UTF-8 character widths. Probably overkill but meh.

* static const.

* Display the layout name in window lists.

* DOH.

* Indentation.

* cvs add is often a good move.

* Merge resize-pane-{up,down} into resize-pane.

* Oops, revert - need u_char.

* Don't need cp.

* This should be fixed now.

* Apply the make magic wand to pick an osdep-*.c file rather than using ifdefs.

* /* $Id$ */

* tmux doesn't care about setres[ug]id.

* getopt_long.c not getopt.c

* Solaris doesn't have TAILQ_REPLACE yet :-(.

* Don't need all this %p stuff anymore really.

* Some tweaks for Solaris. Get rid of vis.* in favour of a small replacement function.

* Ignore tmux*.out as well.

* Use a u_char so top-bit-set update the cursor as well.

* + item.

* Ignore del too.

* Simplify the code by using the generic _target functions.

* No TAILQ_REPLACE on NetBSD.

* Use cmd_prarg to include "s when necessary.

* Convert hidden flag to a full flags word for the status line and add a flag to accept after only one key. Use this so don't need to press enter after y/n for confirm-before.

* +=.

* Perform some black and midnight cpp witchcraft to get rid of GRID_DEBUG, to fix building with -DDEBUG on gcc2 platforms. From joshe.

* Missing Ar.

* Update commands, and options.

* - Add alias to the break-pane command. - s/Asks/Ask/ in the confirm-before command for consistency's sake.

* Avoid using the prompt history when the server is locked, and prevent any input entered from being added to the client's prompt history. From nicm.

* - confirm-before command. - Bound "&" and "x" by default to confirm-before "kill-window" and   confirm-before "kill-pane", respectively.

* Support NEL.

* Use the xenl terminfo flag to detect early-wrap terminals like the FreeBSD console. Many thanks for a very informative email from Christian Weisgerber.

* Note it.

* Gearing up for 0.9....

* Mouse supprot isn't so bad.

* 0.9 here we go.

* Ready for 0.8.

* Document panes stuff.

* Update NOTES.

* Document set-remain-on-exit.

* Document break-pane.

* Document status-keys.

* Move some bits about and add some other bits.

* Document -L and -8, fix synopsis.

* Document -r to bind key.

* Remove the right number of characters from the buffer when escape then a cursor key (or other key prefixed by \033) is pressed. Reported by Stuart Henderson.

* Add mailing lists.

* Update TODO; fix a comment; better screenshot.

* A flag missed.

* rotate-window command.

* +screenshot.

* 09.

* Treat flags properly.

* swap-pane command.

* I can haz screenshots.

* Some stuff is done.

* Update TODO.

* Don't continue to write into panes that are scheduled for redraw.

* Don't permit resizing except in manual mode.

* Change scroll/pane redraws to only redraw the single pane affected rather than the entire window.

* If redrawing the region would mean redrawing > half the pane, just schedule to redraw the entire window. Also add a flag to skip updating the window any further if it is scheduled to be redrawn. This has the effect of batching multiple redraws together.

* Fake warnx().

* - Allow switching to hidden windows (for active-only layout). - Don't update unnecessarily for other layouts when changing active pane doesn't matter.

* Only redraw screen when not hidden. Heh.

* Better errno, from joshe.

* Handle 0 panes better.

* Adjust mouse for x offset.

* Don't need to refresh layout here. Also don't redraw over status line.

* Tweak to CHANGES.

* Basic horizontal splitting and layout management. Still some redraw and other issues - particularly, don't mix with manual pane resizing and be careful when viewing from multiple clients; generally cycling the layout a few times will fix most problems. Getting this in for testing while I think about how to deal with manual mode.

* UTF-8 is now fine, and AIX works.

* 0.8.

* Update www.

* +UTF-8 fixed to CHANGES.

* Close .tmux.conf... DOH.

* FD_CLOEXEC more fds. Still one I can't find...

* More AIX tweaks.

* Update CHANGES.

* Missing \.

* AIX forkpty.

* Most of AIX support.

* Draw vertical line on the right when window size is limited.

* Er, i should be j and c should be u.

* UTF8_SIZE.

* Copy columns correctly.

* Only need to print this once...

* $Id$

* - Unbreak selection colouring. - Get UTF-8 check the right way round...

* Fix UTF-8 in c&p mode.

* Add UTF-8 to grid_compare..

* Include protocol version.

* 8 -> UTF8_SIZE.

* - Ignore padding when writing so copying the screen for copy-mode doesn't include extra characters. - Handle combined characters properly when the previous character is not UTF-8.

* Add some more to server-info.

* Update/reorganise.

* Better UTF-8 support, including combined characters. Unicode data is now stored as UTF-8 in a separate array, the code does a lookup into this every time it gets to a UTF-8 cell. Zero width characters are just appended onto the UTF-8 data for the previous cell. This also means that almost no bytes extra are wasted non-Unicode data (yay).

* _fill functions are no longer needed. Nuke them.

* Whoops. Missed a few changes.

* Step 2 of the Grand Plan To Make UTF-8 Better.

* Now unused variable.

* struct grid_data -> struct grid. Stage 1 of the Grand Plan To Make UTF-8 Better.

* +.

* Key repeating is now a property of the key binding not of the command. Repeat is turned on when the key is bound with the -r flag to bind-key. next/previous- window no longer repeat by default as it turned out to annoy me.

* Clear using ED when redrawing the screen. I foolishly assumed using spaces would be equivalent and terminals would pick up on this, but apparently not. This fixes copy and paste in xterm/rxvt.

* Not const.

* const.

* Whoops. Didn't mean to commit this yet.

* Update TODO.

* Sockets in /tmp are now created in a subdirectory named, tmux-UID, eg tmux-1000. The default socket is thus /tmp/tmux-UID/default. To start a separate server, the new -L command line option should be used: this creates a socket in the same directory with a different name ("-L main" will create socket called "main"). -S should only be used to place the socket outside /tmp. This makes sockets a little more secure and a bit more convenient to use multiple servers.

* Use lstat. No change yet due to realpath call in tmux.c.

* Clear pollfds first.

* Update.

* Typo.

* * New session flag "set-remain-on-exit" to set remain-on-exit flag for new windows created in that session (like "remain-by-default" used to do). Not perfectly happy about this, but until I can think of a good way to introduce it generically (maybe a set of options in the session) this will do. Fixes SF request 2527847.

* Done.

* Support for 88 colour terminals.

* Unused variable.

* char not char *...

* break-pane command to split a pane off into a new window; bound to ! by default.

* CSR resets the cursor to the top-left. Reported by merdely.

* Log socket path so I can tell which tmux log is which.

* Initialise socket_path before parsing configuration file.

* Put socket path in $TMUX.

* Extra function keys from Dashing dashing at hushmail dot com

* Fix window choice mode, again.

* Sort out escape key handling so it works.

* Doh. Set a message when pane is too small rather than dying...

* This is now fixed.

* Don't segfault on lock when no sessions attached.

* Redraw selection properly.

* Update TODO.

* Check the right variable. Doh.

* Don't turn cursor off unless actually drawing something.

* Don't redraw status if it has already been redrawed as part of entire screen.

* Allow selection in vi mode.

* Reuse CPPFLAGS.

* INCDIRS after CPPFLAGS.

* Exclude NetBSD.

* Use CPPFLAGS.

* -err.h.

* Don't die on any error from fd.

* NetBSD flags.

* Don't leak string arguments and options.

* strdup() not necessary here.

* And another memory leak.

* Memory leak.

* Don't leak top line of history and status screen.

* Don't leak existing keys.

* These are fixed.

* Redo mode keys slightly more cleanly and apply them to command prompt editing. vi or emacs mode is controlled by the session option status-keys.

* Reset mode before adding text.

* Use the right row when calling RI.

* More TODO.

* Update TODO.

* Move status prompt/message init and teardown into status.c.

* Reset region before using CUD etc.

* Code tidying on my way to find tmux-in-tmux bug.

* Some extra emacs keys from Christian Weisgerber.

* Looking up argv[0] is expensive, so just use p_comm for the window name which is good enough. Also increase name update time to 500 ms.

* Update TODO.

* Reset name when clearing mode.

* Whoops. Build testing is a good idea...

* Never draw last character: stops stray scrolling sometimes should status line be disabled.

* Only use RI at the top of the screen.

* FreeBSD's console wraps lines at $COLUMNS - 1 rather than $COLUMNS (the cursor can never be beyond $COLUMNS - 1) and does not appear to support changing this behaviour, or any of the obvious possibilities (turning off right margin wrapping, insert mode). This is irritating, most notably because it impossible to write to the very bottom-right of the screen without scrolling. To work around this, if built on FreeBSD and run with a "cons" $TERM, the bottom-right cell on the screen is omitted.

* Update.

* Further unbreakage.

* Unbreak OS X.

* Emulate CSR with existing screen data on old/stupid terminals which don't support it.

* Lose unnecessary cursor restores, fix a couple of placement bugs and remove unused CR.

* Move sx,sy into tty rather than client.

* Don't debug this stuff.

* We are going to need the updated screen data for emulating the scroll region, which may involve changing the cursor position; however, the old (before redraw) cursor position is necessary for writing to the tty. So, save it before doing the redraw then update the internal screen then update the tty.

* Change tty_cmd_* to use a window_pane.

* Split most of tty_cmd_cell off to tty_cell. First step on making tty_cmd_* take a window_pane for later use emulating scroll region.

* Simplify screen/tty write code to eliminate function pointer which is now unnecessary (it always does the same thing).

* Update TODO.

* Don't redraw status line unless it has actually changed. Stops extraneous updates between clock/#() changes and doesn't require manual status-interval 0 when no updates are occuring.

* Update TODO.

* Zero to turn off updates.

* FAQ entry for automatic rename CPU use.

* Return -1 not NULL on error. Doh.

* Don't try to change the window name unless the pid of the process chosen has changed. Reduces CPU use.

* Increase name refresh interval to 250 ms to reduce CPU use.

* Tweak language.

* Typos.

* Test.

* Test syncmail III.

* Test syncmail II.

* Test syncmail.

* Handle "" properly.

* Don't close fds, so error message appears.

* Session name is now shown.

* Continue process if suspended.

* Move to 0.8.

* Remove senseless if statement.

* Don't accept NULL argv[0].

* Use both pgrp.

* More tweakery.

* automatic-rename added.

* Update.

* Comment. Missing OS X headers. +TODO.

* And again.

* Tweak FreeBSD too.

* Even better.

* Make process name guessing pick up SSTOP.

* Time for 0.7.

* Document automatic-rename.

* New sentence, new line.

* Document command sequences.

* Update cursor y on newline otherwise RI gets screwed up at y=0.

* Prevent weird output on OpenBSD (probably on other BSD's too?). From nicm.

* Update.

* - Document find-window. - Document suspend-client. - Document window-status-{attr,bg,fg}. - Options without arguments should be listed first. - s/Copies/Copy/.

* copy-buffer command.

* Update.

* Don't leak fd.

* - Document the -p and -l options in split-window. - Update {copy,scroll}-mode with the -u option. - While there sort options alphabetically.

* {message,status,mode}-attr added

* Support commands with right parenthesis. From nicm and me.

* Fix all rxvt*.

* Missing line break.

* Bye bye debugging.

* move-window bound to ., from joshe.

* Missing ;.

* Format.

* Tweak example.

* Set colour of window entry in status line based on window options.

* Support #(command) in status-left, and status-right.

* Ugh. Another inner loop variable reuse bug.

* Fix page down, again.

* Undo this and just shut lint up.

* Nuke debugging.

* Mouse in copy mode.

* * Better support for at least the most common variant of mouse input: parse it and adjust for different panes. Also support mouse in window/session choice mode. * Bring back the fancy window titles with session/window names: it is easy to work around problems with elinks (see FAQ).

* Exit properly when bas password.

* -u to start with screen scrolled up.

* Avoid warning.

* Tweak selection slightly.

* Close stdin/stdout/stderr.

* Handle cursor on/off better.

* Don't use NULL argv.

* Done!

* Allow status, mode and message attributes to be changed by three new options: status-attr, mode-attr, message-attr. A comma-separataed list is accepted containing: bright, dim, underscore, blink, reverse, hidden, italics, for example: set -g status-attr bright,blink

* +nitems.

* Don't reuse index variable.

* Be more clever about picking window name.

* Don't screw up UTF-8 combined characters.

* Update.

* Typos.

* load-buffer command

* Make the caller responsible for allocating memory for the paste buffer data (needed by the load-buffer command when dealing with big files since it'll prevent tmux from dying due to memory exhaustion). From nicm.

* +CHANGES.

* Missed a reverse.

* Use reverse so status line etc works in terminals w/o colour.

* Raise some limits to INT_MAX, SHRT_MAX is too low.

* Add -a properly.

* Fix this properly...

* Fix next/previous page. DOH.

* Better error messages for fork.

* Return 1 on error. Doh.

* Return -1 on error.

* Update TODO.

* Handle SIGTERM (and kill-server which uses it), a bit more neatly - tidy up properly and print a nicer message. Same effect though :-)

* new-window -k.

* Bring back -p and -l to splitw to specify height as % or nlines.

* Allow a selection in vi keys mode...

* Dont overload DEBUG, use FDEBUG.

* Darwin support for automatic-rename, from joshe.

* Whoops. Ic not It.

* Darwin too.

* Try to change the window title to match the command running it in. This is done by reading argv[0] from the process group leader of the group that owns the tty (tcgetpgrp()). This can't be done portably so some OS-dependent code is introduced (ugh); OpenBSD, FreeBSD and Linux are supported at the moment.

* Die properly with warning.

* Fix various silly problems with status line off.

* Use reverse rather than background which doesn't show up when terminal doesn't support colours.

* Bump protocol.

* Pass return code from _exec; allow command sequences to work from the command line.

* Start the first client with a special socketpair so it is already known to the server rather than playing silly games to get them synchronised before doing anything.

* Leftover label.

* Unbreak UTF-8.

* A couple of trivial optimisations.

* Reset tty saved data on resize.

* +.

* Use the right size.

* This is done.

* Don't die when run non-interactively. DOH.

* -a flags to next/previous window.

* Show tty flags too.

* find-window command.

* Remove object files in the compat directory.

* Add note about the syntax file.

* These should be u_int.

* FreeBSD needs compat/vis.c.

* Update with new features.

* Support command sequences separated by " ; ". Also clean up command printing.

* This is fixed.

* Show (attached) for attached sessions.

* suspend-client command and suspend client when ^Z key binding is used.

* Update for 0.7.

* Update.

* Tidy a few warnings.

* Don't use [4] since they are confusing and use the right size for memset. DOH.

* Actually remove the key binding from the tree when freeing it.

* xterm-keys added

* Add note about configuration breakage.

* Whoops, take out debugging.

* Don't die when last window either.

* Document xterm-keys

* choose-{session,window}, and repeat-time added

* Document repeat-time.

* Document choose-*.

* Update.

* Tweak a little bit.

* Add tabs.

* Example configuration with some screen bindings.

* Document command-prompt template string, and panes commands. From nicm and me.

* Don't die on kill-window.

* Some comments.

* Support #S #H in status-left/right.

* Reorder a bit.

* Document default-path, and update set/setw with the -u flag. From nicm and me.

* Recalculate sizes and don't redraw if unnecessary.

* Show number of panes.

* Be a bit more helpful.

* Whoops. Shut up gcc.

* Two new commands, choose-window and choose-session which work only when bound to a key and allow the window or session to be selected from a list.

* Style/add printflike.

* Increment retries.

* Retry properly when failed to connect.

* Update.

* Whoops, make this work properly.

* Darwin needs vis.c as well.

* Spell check.

* Update NOTES.

* Update NOTES.

* Prettify the key strings a little.

* Repeat for last-window is useless and annoying, take it off.

* Make last-window repeatable too; update my configuration backup, er, example.

* Split windows are done.

* Unbreak prefix as binding.

* Rename some flags I'm not happy about.

* Whoops, stray line.

* Rework the prefix-time stuff. The option is now call repeat-time and defaults to 500 ms. However, it only applies to a small subset of commands, currently: up-pane, down-pane, next-window, previous-window, resize-pane-up, resize-pane-down. These are the commands for which it is obviously useful, having it for everything else was just bloody annoying.

* Alt-up/down to resize by five lines.

* Update.

* switch-pane is now select-pane.

* up-pane and down-pane commands.

* Multiple window splitting.

* Using the rigth option name would help...

* Document -g.

* Disable lock-after-time by default.

* Turn off prefix-time for the moment, it is too annoying.

* kill-pane command.

* command-prompt now accepts a single argument, a template string. Any occurrences of %% in this string are replaced by whatever is entered at the prompt and the result is executed as a command. This allows things like (now bound by default):

* Reset command timer after this or it gets annoying.

* prefix-time option to allow multiple commands without additional prefixes.

* Make shift arrow keys work.

* More hacks for key handling.

* Use -O0 to prevent copy issues.

* Codes no longer needed.

* Window splitting. Two vertical panes fixed 50% each. This is a huge diff, still a couple of bugs (notably heap corruption somewhere causing segfault on exit).

* save-buffer command, from Tiago Cunha.

* Doh. Return the offset not the total.

* Give up the farce of caring about any keys aside from the ones in the screen termcap and the ones termcap doesn't handle that we hardcode manually.

* Utility files.

* Update CHANGES.

* When I wrote this I somehow forgot that the cursor could helpfully sit at sx (one character off the right of the screen), so there are several out-of-bounds issues. Add some additional checking.

* Don't die when out of bounds if non-DEBUG. Stops people hitting me when bugs kill their long-running sessions in release versions.

* Kill warning.

* Ability to show window title on status line.

* +.

* Support dfly, from joshe.

* Fix build on sparc.

* Bump NSETOPTION.

* Update NOTES.

* Document mode keys

* Disable UTF-8 by default and add options to enable it.

* y not x :-/

* Ooops. Check the right value.

* TAILQ -> SLIST.

* Don't try to redraw status line in prompt mode.

* Style tweaks.

* Fix bold/non-bold mismatch in 256 colour mode by adding an extra 8 bits (ick) onto the attributes and using two of them to mark the fg and bg as 256 colours when necessary. If only it was 255 colours we would have one value for default and wouln't need this :-/.

* Comments.

* Get defaults the right way round.

* Lose ensure* stuff.

* This order is required for -static.

* Comment tweak.

* == 0 not == NULL

* Environment variables in configuration file.

* This idea (nested sessions) is fraught with too many problems to do it sanely; for example, in order not to be annoying, previous-window would have to work as expected (jump back to previous session) but what if you enter the same session from different parent sessions? What is the previous window? It would have to be tied to the client. There are other issues as well, and I don't see it as terribly useful (you can bind a switch-client command to any key anyway), so it is off the list.

* Spacing.

* Memory leak/missing init.

* Document show-options.

* show-window-options command.

* Add a couple of extra option types, and implement show-options command.

* I'm an idiot - it is start,len not start,end. Unbreak.

* New window options: force-width and force-height. This will force a window to   an arbitrary width and height (0 for the default unlimited). This is neat for   emacs which doesn't have a sensible way to force hard wrapping at 80   columns. Also, don't try to be clever and use clr_eol when redrawing the   whole screen, it causes trouble since the redraw functions are used to draw   the blank areas too.

* Clear blank area properly on redraw, and add a marker line below it.

* Don't die on empty strings.

* Some Linux fixes; some code tidying. Don't redraw status bar so often.

* ich emulation should maintain cursor position; bug spotted by merdely.

* Usage update from Will Maier.

* Don't use entry init since it may be dependent on key.

* status is a toggle.

* Make monitor-activity w/o arguments toggle.

* Update.

* + comments.

* Disable/enable window activity monitoring with set-window-option command.

* Add activity monitoring, also invert items on taskbar which have activity.

* Bring select-window into line with everything else wrt -i.

* Don't crash when looking at NULL clients; also redraw everything on status change.

* Status bar left and right strings (set with status-left and status-right), and automatic update (at interval set by status-interval).

* Per-session configuration options.

* tree.h has RB_PREV now, yay!

* Quick man page update, also fix some usages and get rid of some CMD_KEY checks.

* Daemonise before loading configuration.

* start-server command to start server and nothing else.

* Last bits of basic configuration file. By default in ~/.tmux.conf or specified with -f. Just a list of tmux commands executed when the server is started and before and any session/window is created.

* Remove old examples, add new.

* Return error cause properly.

* Clear msgdata where it is unavailable.

* Move -s and -c down a level so handling them is the responsibility of the command (with some helper functions), rather than the top-level. This changes the action command syntax so that -s and -c must be after the command rather than before.

* Prepare TERM in buffer before sending; this allows size to be part of cmd and prevents it being split. This is the only place this happens so remove it from todo.

* +.

* Don't die if no dst window and -k to linkw.

* New command, send-keys, to send a set of keys.

* +.

* s/backgroun/background/

* Bug fix; don't bail except on first line when printing.

* Workaround FreeBSD problems with deleting terms.

* Only close the tty during exit process and leave freeing it to when the socket is lost.

* Use the right function...

* Save term data in a linked list and reuse it.

* Fix charset stuff.

* Sync.

* Clean up after error properly.

* Restore termcap checks.

* Redraw buglets.

* set/reset mode window functions.

* Major reorganisation of screen handling.

* Don't try to access more windows if the session has been destroyed.

* Handle missing parm_*.

* Clear before resize.

* The tty code already stores attributes and doesn't modify them if unaltered, so the screen drawing code doesn't need to do so too. This probably also fixes bugs when switching screens where the actual tty attributes may not have been what the draw code (erroneously) expected.

* Sync .cvsignore.

* home and end appear to be find/select with rxvt...

* Better error messages with no server.

* Erm, check the right cell... d'oh.

* Heh. 2300 not 1200.

* Rv EOL optimisation, it screws up selection.

* Add ^A && ^E to copy mode. Also use STDIN instead of STDOUT in a couple of places.

* Update SRCS, use -rdynamic in DEBUG case, lose openssl crap.

* Sync SRCS.

* Disable this optimisation since cursor can be updated by stuff outside.

* Oops, use correct y.

* Init local_log to -1.

* Redo output logging in local.c. Optimise line drawing.

* Support for VT100 graphics mode. Also lose some redundant checks.

* Always redraw requesting client on resize.

* Scroll region reset homes the cursor, so start at 0,0 when drawing. Also don't set region after DECRC.

* Reset before calling window_draw otherwise it'll have the wrong idea of the current state (since it copies from screen).

* Don't stop until after everything else done.

* Better words.

* Use screen_draw_* to write message, avoids leaving attribute changes around.

* Sync.

* Mention quit key. Fix key style.

* Oops, missing one BACKGOUND.

* Split SCREEN_BACKGROUND flag into BACKGROUND/NOCURSOR in preparation for copy mode.

* Check for NULL clients.

* Don't count actual struct, don't count size twice.

* Cut memory consumption by only allocating lines when there is actually data on them, and only as much as the right-most data. Everything else is filled in at runtime.

* Free entire screen when destroyed.

* Document scroll-mode.

* Don't switch to scroll mode unless no other mode.

* The CLIENT_HOLD hack can go bye-bye.

* Sort out cursors with a new flag - BACKGROUND - for window modes. Free text on more exit.

* Scrollable win for command output.

* Redo screen.c functions to make them readable and more flexible. Make scroll mode only redraw waht it needs.

* Fast up/down line scroll.

* Horizontal history/scrolling.

* Wipe curw so last doesn't end up as deleted.

* Fix use-after-free.

* Move from the right place.

* Scroll data should be per-window not global.

* Initial history support.

* Damnit, wrong variable name..

* Oops, mustn't forget this.

* Mass screen.c rename/tidy. Add a actual size (ysize) as distinct from display size (now dx,dy). Move functions which work on the displayed area into screen-display.c and tidy. Use macros consistently when accessing screen data (may want to move everything about again later!). This the first step on the road to scrollback.

* Style: ry_* -> r*

* Fix a format string bug and sprinkle some printflikes.

* +index.html.in

* Work around Linux realpath breakage.

* Note about default colours.

* dist target.

* Check for scrolling when _cursor_ is inside region, not number of lines. Duh.

* Report available commands on ambiguous commands. Tidy TODO a bit.

* Sync.

* Use ctx->client/ctx->session inline instead of temporary variables which were being reused and causing confusion and problems.

* Tweak.

* This stuff should be Ic not Ar.

* Mention TERM=screen requirement.

* Force default colours if terminal supports it.

* clietns -> clients.

* Nuke stray ).

* Double-free on session destroy.

* Tweak.

* Erp, ^B not ^A.

* -S for socket, -s for session.

* Extend op string and add potential for a single alias.

* Don't close stderr in log_close to make -v/-vv work again.

* Join oldest session if non specified. Fix errors.

* Restore list command.

* Whoops, these need to be terminated.

* These are no longer unused.

* Unlink and retry if server socket connect fails.

* Server function naming, still not happy with server stuff though.

* Restore -n, now after the command.

* Cleanup part II: split up client stuff and ops. More to come.

* Cleanup part 1: split up server.c.

* Pass through backspace for now.

* Tweak ordering.

* Remove window before working out new current window; clear last window if necessary.

* Some code tidying, use macros in a few more places.

* And more.

* Log missing terminfo vars rather than dying.

* Initial import to CVS. Basic functions are working, albeit with a couple of showstopper memory bugs and many missing features. Detaching, reattaching, creating new sessions, listing sessions work acceptably for using with shells. Simple curses programs (top, systat, tetris) and more complicated ones (mutt, emacs) that don't require scrolling regions (ESC[r) mostly work fine (including mutt, emacs). No status bar yet and no key remapping or other customisation.

* Standard project directories initialized by cvs2svn.

CHANGES FROM 3.3a to 3.4

* Add options keep-last and keep-group to destroy-unattached to keep the last
  session whether in a group.

* Don't allow paste-buffer into dead panes.

* Add -t to source-file.

* Rewrite combined character handling to be more consistent and to support
  newer Unicode combined characters.

* Add basic support for SIXEL if built with --enable-sixel.

* Add a session, pane and user mouse range types for the status line and add
  format variables for mouse_status_line and mouse_status_range so they can be
  associated with different commands in the key bindings.

* Add flag (-o) to next-prompt/previous-prompt to go to OSC 133 command output.

* Add options and flags for menu styles (menu-style, menu-border-style) similar
  to those existing for popups.

* Add support for marking lines with a shell prompt based on the OSC 133 extension.

* Check for libterminfo for NetBSD.

* Add "us" to styles for underscore colour.

* Add flags (-c and -y) to change the confirm key and default behaviour of
  confirm-before.

* Use ncurses' new tparm_s function (added in 6.4-20230424) instead of tparm so
  it does not object to string arguments in c apabilities it doesn't already
  know. Also ignore errors from tparm if using previous ncurses versions.

* Set default lock command to vlock on Linux if present at build time.

* Discard mouse sequences that have the right form but actually are invalid.

* Add support for spawning panes in separate cgroups with systemd and a
  configure flag (--disable-cgroups) to turn off.

* Add a format (pane_unseen_changes) to show if there are unseen changes while
  in a mode.

* Remove old buffer when renaming rather than complaining.

* Add an L modifier like P, W, S to loop over clients.

* Add -f to list-clients like the other list commands.

* Extend display-message to work for control clients.

* Add a flag to display-menu to select the manu item selected when the menu is
  open.

* Have tmux recognise pasted text wrapped in bracket paste sequences, rather
  than only forwarding them to the program inside.

* Have client return 1 if process is interrupted to an input pane.

* Query the client terminal for foreground and background colours and if OSC 10
  or 11 is received but no colour has been set inside tmux, return the colour
  from the first attached client.

* Add send-keys -K to handle keys directly as if typed (so look up in key
  table).

* Process escape sequences in show-buffer.

* Add a -l flag to display-message to disable format expansion.

* Add paste-buffer-deleted notification and fix name of paste-buffer-changed.

* Do not attempt to connect to the socket as a client if systemd is active.

* Add scroll-top and scroll-bottom commands to scroll so cursor is at top or
  bottom.

* Add a -T flag to capture-pane to stop at the last used cell instead of the
  full width. Restore the previous behaviour by making it default to off unless
  -J is used.

* Add message-line option to control where message and prompt go.

* Notification when a when a paste buffer is deleted.

* Add a Nobr terminfo(5) capability to tell tmux the terminal does not use bright
  colours for bold.

* Change g and G to go to top and bottom in menus.

* Add a third state "all" to allow-passthrough to work even in invisible panes.

* Add support for OSC 8 hyperlinks.

* Store the time lines are scrolled into history and display in copy mode.

* Add a %config-error reply to control mode for configuration file errors since
  reporting them in view mode is useless.

* A new feature flag (ignorefkeys) to ignore terminfo(5) function key
  definitions for rxvt.

* Pass through first argument to OSC 52 (which clipboards to set) if the
  application provides it.

* Expand arguments to send-keys, capture-pane, split-window, join-pane where it
  makes sense to do so.

* Ignore named buffers when choosing a buffer if one is not specified by the user.

CHANGES FROM 3.3 TO 3.3a

* Do not crash when run-shell produces output from a config file.

* Do not unintentionally turn off all mouse mode when button mode is also
  present.

CHANGES FROM 3.2a TO 3.3

* Add an ACL list for users connecting to the tmux socket. Users may be
  forbidden from attaching, forced to attach read-only, or allowed to attach
  read-write. A new command, server-access, configures the list. File system
  permissions must still be configured manually.

* Emit window-layout-changed on swap-pane.

* Better error reporting when applying custom layouts.

* Handle ANSI escape sequences in run-shell output.

* Add pane_start_path to match start_command.

* Set PWD so shells have a hint about the real path.

* Do not allow pipe-pane on dead panes.

* Do not report mouse positions (incorrectly) above the maximum of 223 in
  normal mouse mode.

* Add an option (default off) to control the passthrough escape sequence.

* Support more mouse buttons when the terminal sends them.

* Add a window-resized hook which is fired when the window is actually resized
  which may be later than the client resize.

* Add next_session_id format with the next session ID.

* Add formats for client and server UID and user.

* Add argument to refresh-client -l to forward clipboard to a pane.

* Add remain-on-exit-format to set text shown when pane is dead.

* With split-window -f use percentages of window size not pane size.

* Add an option (fill-character) to set the character used for unused areas of
  a client.

* Add an option (scroll-on-clear) to control if tmux scrolls into history on
  clear.

* Add a capability for OSC 7 and use it similarly to how the title is set (and
  controlled by the same set-titles option).

* Add support for systemd socket activation (where systemd creates the Unix
  domain socket for tmux rather than tmux creating it). Build with
  --enable-systemd.

* Add an option (pane-border-indicators) to select how the active pane is shown
  on the pane border (colour, arrows or both).

* Support underscore styles with capture-pane -e.

* Make pane-border-format a pane option rather than window.

* Respond to OSC 4 queries

* Fix g/G keys in modes to do the same thing as copy mode (and vi).

* Bump the time terminals have to respond to device attributes queries to three
  seconds.

* If automatic-rename is off, allow the rename escape sequence to set an empty
  name.

* Trim menu item text more intelligently.

* Add cursor-style and cursor-colour options to set the default cursor style
  and colour.

* Accept some useful and non-conflicting emacs keys in vi normal mode at the
  command prompt.

* Add a format modifier (c) to force a colour to RGB.

* Add -s and -S to display-popup to set styles, -b to set lines and -T to set
  popup title. New popup-border-lines, popup-border-style and popup-style
  options set the defaults.

* Add -e flag to set an environment variable for a popup.

* Make send-keys without arguments send the key it is bound to (if bound to a
  key).

* Try to leave terminal cursor at the right position even when tmux is drawing
  its own cursor or selection (such as at the command prompt and in choose
  mode) for people using screen readers and similar which can make use of it.

* Change so that {} is converted to tmux commands immediately when parsed. This
  means it must contain valid tmux commands. For commands which expand %% and
  %%%, this now only happens within string arguments. Use of nested aliases
  inside {} is now forbidden. Processing of commands given in quotes remains
  the same.

* Disable evports on SunOS since they are broken.

* Do not expand the file given with tmux -f so it can contain :s.

* Bump FORMAT_LOOP_LIMIT and add a log message when hit.

* Add a terminal feature for the mouse (since FreeBSD termcap does not have kmous).

* Forbid empty session names.

* Improve error reporting when the tmux /tmp directory cannot be created or
  used.

* Give #() commands a one second grace period where the output is empty before
  telling the user they aren't doing anything ("not ready").

* When building, pick default-terminal from the first of tmux-256color, tmux,
  screen-256color, screen that is available on the build system (--with-TERM
  can override).

* Do not close popups on resize, instead adjust them to fit.

* Add a client-active hook.

* Make window-linked and window-unlinked window options.

* Do not configure on macOS without the user making a choice about utf8proc
  (either --enable-utf8proc or --disable-utf8proc).

* Do not freeze output in panes when a popup is open, let them continue to
  redraw.

* Add pipe variants of the line copy commands.

* Change copy-line and copy-end-of-line not to cancel and add -and-cancel
  variants, like the other copy commands.

* Support the OSC palette-setting sequences in popups.

* Add a pane-colours array option to specify the defaults palette.

* Add support for Unicode zero-width joiner.

* Make newline a style delimiter as well so they can cross multiple lines for
  readability in configuration files.

* Change focus to be driven by events rather than scanning panes so the
  ordering of in and out is consistent.

* Add display-popup -B to open a popup without a border.

* Add a menu for popups that can be opened with button three outside the popup
  or on the left or top border. Resizing now only works on the right and bottom
  borders or when using Meta. The menu allows a popup to be closed, expanded to
  the full size of the client, centered in the client or changed into a pane.

* Make command-prompt and confirm-before block by default (like run-shell). A
  new -b flags runs them in the background as before. Also set return code for
  confirm-before.

* Change cursor style handling so tmux understands which sequences contain
  blinking and sets the flag appropriately, means that it works whether cnorm
  disables blinking or not. This now matches xterm's behaviour.

* More accurate vi(1) word navigation in copy mode and on the status line. This
  changes the meaning of the word-separators option: setting it to the empty
  string is equivalent to the previous behavior.

* Add -F for command-prompt and use it to fix "Rename" on the window menu.

* Add different command histories for different types of prompts ("command",
  "search" etc).

CHANGES FROM 3.2 TO 3.2a

* Add an "always" value for the "extended-keys" option; if set then tmux will
  forward extended keys to applications even if they do not request them.

* Add a "mouse" terminal feature so tmux can enable the mouse on terminals
  where it is known to be supported even if terminfo(5) says otherwise.

* Do not expand the filename given to -f so it can contain colons.

* Fixes for problems with extended keys and modifiers, scroll region,
  source-file, crosscompiling, format modifiers and other minor issues.

CHANGES FROM 3.1c TO 3.2

* Add a flag to disable keys to close a message.

* Permit shortcut keys in buffer, client, tree modes to be configured with a
  format (-K flag to choose-buffer, choose-client, choose-tree).

* Add a current_file format for the config file being parsed.

* When display-message used in config file, show the message after the config
  file finishes.

* Add client-detached notification in control mode.

* Improve performance of format evaluation.

* Make jump command support UTF-8 in copy mode.

* Support X11 colour names and other colour formats for OSC 10 and 11.

* Add "pipe" variants of "copy-pipe" commands which do not copy.

* Include "focused" in client flags.

* Send Unicode directional isolate characters around horizontal pane borders if
  the terminal supports UTF-8 and an extension terminfo(5) capability "Bidi" is
  present.

* Add a -S flag to new-window to make it select the existing window if one
  with the given name already exists rather than failing with an error.

* Add a format modifier to check if a window or session name exists (N/w or
  N/s).

* Add compat clock_gettime for older macOS.

* Add a no-detached choice to detach-on-destroy which detaches only if there
  are no other detached sessions to switch to.

* Add rectangle-on and rectangle-off copy mode commands.

* Change so that window_flags escapes # automatically. A new format
  window_raw_flags contains the old unescaped version.

* Add -N flag to never start server even if command would normally do so.

* With incremental search, start empty and only repeat the previous search if
  the user tries to search again with an empty prompt.

* Add a value for remain-on-exit that only keeps the pane if the program
  failed.

* Add a -C flag to run-shell to use a tmux command rather than a shell command.

* Do not list user options with show-hooks.

* Remove current match indicator in copy mode which can't work anymore since we
  only search the visible region.

* Make synchronize-panes a pane option and add -U flag to set-option to unset
  an option on all panes.

* Make replacement of ##s consistent when drawing formats, whether followed by
  [ or not. Add a flag (e) to the q: format modifier to double up #s.

* Add -N flag to display-panes to ignore keys.

* Change how escaping is processed for formats so that ## and # can be used in
  styles.

* Add a 'w' format modifier for string width.

* Add support for Haiku.

* Expand menu and popup -x and -y as formats.

* Add numeric comparisons for formats.

* Fire focus events even when the pane is in a mode.

* Add -O flag to display-menu to not automatically close when all mouse buttons
  are released.

* Allow fnmatch(3) wildcards in update-environment.

* Disable nested job expansion so that the result of #() is not expanded again.

* Use the setal capability as well as (tmux's) Setulc.

* Add -q flag to unbind-key to hide errors.

* Allow -N without a command to change or add a note to an existing key.

* Add a -w flag to set- and load-buffer to send to clipboard using OSC 52.

* Add -F to set-environment and source-file.

* Allow colour to be spelt as color in various places.

* Add n: modifier to get length of a format.

* Respond to OSC colour requests if a colour is available.

* Add a -d option to display-message to set delay.

* Add a way for control mode clients to subscribe to a format and be notified
  of changes rather than having to poll.

* Add some formats for search in copy mode (search_present, search_match).

* Do not wait on shutdown for commands started with run -b.

* Add -b flags to insert a window before (like the existing -a for after) to
  break-pane, move-window, new-window.

* Make paste -p the default for ].

* Add support for pausing a pane when the output buffered for a control mode
  client gets too far behind. The pause-after flag with a time is set on the
  pane with refresh-client -f and a paused pane may be resumed with
  refresh-client -A.

* Allow strings in configuration files to span multiple lines - newlines and
  any leading whitespace are removed, as well as any following comments that
  couldn't be part of a format. This allows long formats or other strings to be
  annotated and indented.

* Instead of using a custom parse function to process {} in configuration
  files, treat as a set of statements the same as outside {} and convert back
  to a string as the last step. This means the rules are consistent inside and
  outside {}, %if and friends work at the right time, and the final result
  isn't littered with unnecessary newlines.

* Add support for extended keys - both xterm(1)'s CSI 27 ~ sequence and the
  libtickit CSI u sequence are accepted; only the latter is output. tmux will
  only attempt to use these if the extended-keys option is on and it can detect
  that the terminal outside supports them (or is told it does with the
  "extkeys" terminal feature).

* Add an option to set the pane border lines style from a choice of single
  lines (ACS or UTF-8), double or heavy (UTF-8), simple (plain ASCII) or number
  (the pane numbers). Lines that won't work on a non-UTF-8 terminal are
  translated back into ACS when they are output.

* Make focus events update the latest client (like a key press).

* Store UTF-8 characters differently to reduce memory use.

* Fix break-pane -n when only one pane in the window.

* Instead of sending all data to control mode clients as fast as possible, add
  a limit of how much data will be sent to the client and try to use it for
  panes with some degree of fairness.

* Add an active-pane client flag (set with attach-session -f, new-session -f
  or refresh-client -f). This allows a client to have an independent active
  pane for interactive use (the window client pane is still used for many
  things however).

* Add a mark to copy mode, this is set with the set-mark command (bound to X)
  and appears with the entire line shown using copy-mode-mark-style and the
  marked character in reverse. The jump-to-mark command (bound to M-x) swaps
  the mark and the cursor positions.

* Add a -D flag to make the tmux server run in the foreground and not as a
  daemon.

* Do not loop forever in copy mode when search finds an empty match.

* Fix the next-matching-bracket logic when using vi(1) keys.

* Add a customize mode where options may be browsed and changed, includes
  adding a brief description of each option. Bound to C-b C by default.

* Change message log (C-b ~) so there is one for the server rather than one per
  client and it remains after detach, and make it useful by logging every
  command.

* Add M-+ and M-- to tree mode to expand and collapse all.

* Change the existing client flags for control mode to apply for any client,
  use the same mechanism for the read-only flag and add an ignore-size flag.

  refresh-client -F has become -f (-F stays for backwards compatibility) and
  attach-session and switch-client now have -f flags also. A new format
  client_flags lists the flags and is shown by list-clients by default.

  This separates the read-only flag from "ignore size" behaviour (new
  ignore-size) flag - both behaviours are useful in different circumstances.

  attach -r and switchc -r remain and set or toggle both flags together.

* Store and restore cursor position when copy mode is resized.

* Export TERM_PROGRAM and TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION like various other terminals.

* Add formats for after hook command arguments: hook_arguments with all the
  arguments together; hook_argument_0, hook_argument_1 and so on with
  individual arguments; hook_flag_X if flag -X is present; hook_flag_X_0,
  hook_flag_X_1 and so on if -X appears multiple times.

* Try to search the entire history first for up to 200 ms so a search count can
  be shown. If it takes too long, search the visible text only.

* Use VIS_CSTYLE for paste buffers also (show \012 as \n).

* Change default formats for tree mode, client mode and buffer mode to be more
  compact and remove some clutter.

* Add a key (e) in buffer mode to open the buffer in an editor. The buffer
  contents is updated when the editor exits.

* Add -e flag for new-session to set environment variables, like the same flag
  for new-window.

* Improve search match marking in copy mode. Two new options
  copy-mode-match-style and copy-mode-current-match-style to set the style for
  matches and for the current match respectively. Also a change so that if a
  copy key is pressed with no selection, the current match (if any) is copied.

* Sanitize session names like window names instead of forbidding invalid ones.

* Check if the clear terminfo(5) capability starts with CSI and if so then
  assume the terminal is VT100-like, rather than relying on the XT capability.

* Improve command prompt tab completion and add menus both for strings and -t
  and -s (when used without a trailing space). command-prompt has additional
  flags for only completing a window (-W) and a target (-T), allowing C-b ' to
  only show windows and C-b . only targets.

* Change all the style options to string options so they can support formats.
  Change pane-active-border-style to use this to change the border colour when
  in a mode or with synchronize-panes on. This also implies a few minor changes
  to existing behaviour:

  - set-option -a with a style option automatically inserts a comma between the
    old value and appended text.

  - OSC 10 and 11 no longer set the window-style option, instead they store the
    colour internally in the pane data and it is used as the default when the
    option is evaluated.

  - status-fg and -bg now override status-style instead of the option values
    being changed.

* Add extension terminfo(5) capabilities for margins and focus reporting.

* Try $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tmux/tmux.conf as well as ~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf for
  configuration file (the search paths are in TMUX_CONF in Makefile.am).

* Remove the DSR 1337 iTerm2 extension and replace by the extended device
  attributes sequence (CSI > q) supported by more terminals.

* Add a -s flag to copy-mode to specify a different pane for the source
  content. This means it is possible to view two places in a pane's history at
  the same time in different panes, or view the history while still using the
  pane. Pressing r refreshes the content from the source pane.

* Add an argument to list-commands to show only a single command.

* Change copy mode to make copy of the pane history so it does not need to
  freeze the pane.

* Restore pane_current_path format from portable tmux on OpenBSD.

* Wait until the initial command sequence is done before sending a device
  attributes request and other bits that prompt a reply from the terminal. This
  means that stray replies are not left on the terminal if the command has
  attached and then immediately detached and tmux will not be around to receive
  them.

* Add a -f filter argument to the list commands like choose-tree.

* Move specific hooks for panes to pane options and windows for window options
  rather than all hooks being session options. These hooks are now window options:

  window-layout-changed
  window-linked
  window-pane-changed
  window-renamed
  window-unlinked

  And these are now pane options:

  pane-died
  pane-exited
  pane-focus-in
  pane-focus-out
  pane-mode-changed
  pane-set-clipboard

  Any existing configurations using these hooks on a session rather than
  globally (that is, set-hook or set-option without -g) may need to be changed.

* Show signal names when a process exits with remain-on-exit on platforms which
  have a way to get them.

* Start menu with top item selected if no mouse and use mode-style for the
  selected item.

* Add a copy-command option and change copy-pipe and friends to pipe to it if
  used without arguments, allows all the default copy key bindings to be
  changed to pipe with one option rather than needing to change each key
  binding individually.

* Tidy up the terminal detection and feature code and add named sets of
  terminal features, each of which are defined in one place and map to a
  builtin set of terminfo(5) capabilities. Features can be specified based on
  TERM with a new terminal-features option or with the -T flag when running
  tmux. tmux will also detect a few common terminals from the DA and DSR
  responses.

  This is intended to make it easier to configure tmux's use of terminfo(5)
  even in the presence of outdated ncurses(3) or terminfo(5) databases or for
  features which do not yet have a terminfo(5) entry. Instead of having to grok
  terminfo(5) capability names and what they should be set to in the
  terminal-overrides option, the user can hopefully just give tmux a feature
  name and let it do the right thing.

  The terminal-overrides option remains both for backwards compatibility and to
  allow tweaks of individual capabilities.

* Support mintty's application escape sequence (means tmux doesn't have to
  delay to wait for Escape, so no need to reduce escape-time when using
  mintty).

* Change so main-pane-width and height can be given as a percentage.

* Support for the iTerm2 synchronized updates feature (allows the terminal to
  avoid unnecessary drawing while output is still in progress).

* Make the mouse_word and mouse_line formats work in copy mode and enable the
  default pane menu in copy mode.

* Add a -T flag to resize-pane to trim lines below the cursor, moving lines out
  of the history.

* Add a way to mark environment variables as "hidden" so they can be used by
  tmux (for example in formats) but are not set in the environment for new
  panes. set-environment and show-environment have a new -h flag and there is a
  new %hidden statement for the configuration file.

* Change default position for display-menu -x and -y to centre rather than top
  left.

* Add support for per-client transient popups, similar to menus but which are
  connected to an external command (like a pane). These are created with new
  command display-popup.

* Change double and triple click bindings so that only one is fired (previously
  double click was fired on the way to triple click). Also add default double
  and triple click bindings to copy the word or line under the cursor and
  change the existing bindings in copy mode to do the same.

* Add a default binding for button 2 to paste.

* Add -d flag to run-shell to delay before running the command and allow it to
  be used without a command so it just delays.

* Add C-g to cancel command prompt with vi keys as well as emacs, and q in
  command mode.

* When the server socket is given with -S, create it with umask 177 instead of
  117 (because it may not be in a safe directory like the default directory in
  /tmp).

* Add a copy-mode -H flag to hide the position marker in the top right.

* Add number operators for formats (+, -, *, / and m),

CHANGED FROM 3.1b TO 3.1c

* Do not write after the end of the array and overwrite the stack when
  colon-separated SGR sequences contain empty arguments.

CHANGES FROM 3.1a TO 3.1b

* Fix build on systems without sys/queue.h.

* Fix crash when allow-rename is on and an empty name is set.

CHANGES FROM 3.1 TO 3.1a

* Do not close stdout prematurely in control mode since it is needed to print
  exit messages. Prevents hanging when detaching with iTerm2.

CHANGES FROM 3.0a TO 3.1

* Only search the visible part of the history when marking (highlighting)
  search terms. This is much faster than searching the whole history and solves
  problems with large histories. The count of matches shown is now the visible
  matches rather than all matches.

* Search using regular expressions in copy mode. search-forward and
  search-backward use regular expressions by default; the incremental versions
  do not.

* Turn off mouse mode 1003 as well as the rest when exiting.

* Add selection_active format for when the selection is present but not moving
  with the cursor.

* Fix dragging with modifier keys, so binding keys such as C-MouseDrag1Pane and
  C-MouseDragEnd1Pane now work.

* Add -a to list-keys to also list keys without notes with -N.

* Do not jump to next word end if already on a word end when selecting a word;
  fixes select-word with single character words and vi(1) keys.

* Fix top and bottom pane calculation with pane border status enabled.

* Add support for adding a note to a key binding (with bind-key -N) and use
  this to add descriptions to the default key bindings. A new -N flag to
  list-keys shows key bindings with notes. Change the default ? binding to use
  this to show a readable summary of keys. Also extend command-prompt to return
  the name of the key pressed and add a default binding (/) to show the note
  for the next key pressed.

* Add support for the iTerm2 DSR 1337 sequence to get the terminal version.

* Treat plausible but invalid keys (like C-BSpace) as literal like any other
  unrecognised string passed to send-keys.

* Detect iTerm2 and enable use of DECSLRM (much faster with horizontally split
  windows).

* Add -Z to default switch-client command in tree mode.

* Add ~ to quoted characters for %%%.

* Document client exit messages in the manual page.

* Do not let read-only clients limit the size, unless all clients are
  read-only.

* Add a number of new formats to inspect what sessions and clients a window is
  present or active in.

* Change file reading and writing to go through the client if necessary. This
  fixes commands like "tmux loadb /dev/fd/X". Also modify source-file to
  support "-" for standard input, like load-buffer and save-buffer.

* Add ~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf to the default search path for configuration
  files.

* Bump the escape sequence timeout to five seconds to allow for longer
  legitimate sequences.

* Make a best effort to set xpixel and ypixel for each pane and add formats for
  them.

* Add push-default to status-left and status-right in status-format[0].

* Do not clear search marks on cursor movement with vi(1) keys.

* Add p format modifier for padding to width and allow multiple substitutions
  in a single format.

* Add -f for full size to join-pane (like split-window).

* Do not use bright when emulating 256 colours on an 8 colour terminal because
  it is also bold on some terminals.

* Make select-pane -P set window-active-style also to match previous behaviour.

* Do not truncate list-keys output.

* Turn automatic-rename back on if the \033k rename escape sequence is used
  with an empty name.

* Add support for percentage sizes for resize-pane ("-x 10%"). Also change
  split-window and join-pane -l to accept similar percentages and deprecate the
  -p flag.

* Add -F flag to send-keys to expand formats in search-backward and forward
  copy mode commands and copy_cursor_word and copy_cursor_line formats for word
  and line at cursor in copy mode. Use for default # and * binding with vi(1)
  keys.

* Add formats for word and line at cursor position in copy mode.

* Add formats for cursor and selection position in copy mode.

* Support all the forms of RGB colour strings in OSC sequences rather than
  requiring two digits.

* Limit lazy resize to panes in attached sessions only.

* Add an option to set the key sent by backspace for those whose system uses ^H
  rather than ^?.

* Change new-session -A without a session name (that is, no -s option also) to
  attach to the best existing session like attach-session rather than a new
  one.

* Add a "latest" window-size option which tries to size windows based on the
  most recently used client. This is now the default.

* Add simple support for OSC 7 (result is available in the pane_path format).

* Add push-default and pop-default for styles which change the colours and
  attributes used for #[default]. These are used in status-format to restore
  the behaviour of window-status-style being the default for
  window-status-format.

* Add window_marked_flag.

* Add cursor-down-and-cancel in copy mode.

* Default to previous search string for search-forward and search-backward.

* Add -Z flag to rotate-window, select-pane, swap-pane, switch-client to
  preserve zoomed state.

* Add -N to capture-pane to preserve trailing spaces.

* Add reverse sorting in tree, client and buffer modes.

CHANGES FROM 3.0 TO 3.0a

* Do not require REG_STARTEND.

* Respawn panes or windows correctly if default-command is set.

* Add missing option for after-kill-pane hook.

* Fix for crash with a format variable that doesn't exist.

* Do not truncate list-keys output on some platforms.

* Do not crash when restoring a layout with only one pane.

CHANGES FROM 2.9 TO 3.0

* Workaround invalid layout strings generated by older tmux versions and add
  some additional sanity checks

* xterm 348 now disables margins when resized, so send DECLRMM again after
  resize.

* Add support for the SD (scroll down) escape sequence.

* Expand arguments to C and s format modifiers to match the m modifier.

* Add support for underscore colours (Setulc capability must be added with
  terminal-overrides as described in tmux(1)).

* Add a "fill" style attribute for the fill colour of the drawing area (where
  appropriate).

* New -H flag to send-keys to send literal keys.

* Format variables for pane mouse modes (mouse_utf8_flag and mouse_sgr_flag)
  and for origin mode (origin_flag).

* Add -F to refresh-client for flags for control mode clients, only one flag
  (no-output) supported at the moment.

* Add a few vi(1) keys for menus.

* Add pane options, set with set-option -p and displayed with show-options -p.
  Pane options inherit from window options (so every pane option is also
  a window option). The pane style is now configured by setting window-style
  and window-active-style in the pane options; select-pane -P and -g now change
  the option but are no longer documented.

* Do not document set-window-option and show-window-options. set-option -w and
  show-options -w should be used instead.

* Add a -A flag to show-options to show parent options as well (they are marked
  with a *).

* Resize panes lazily - do not resize unless they are in an attached, active
  window.

* Add regular expression support for the format search, match and substitute
  modifiers and make them able to ignore case. find-window now accepts -r to
  use regular expressions.

* Do not use $TMUX to find the session because for windows in multiple sessions
  it is wrong as often as it is right, and for windows in one session it is
  pointless. Instead use TMUX_PANE if it is present.

* Do not always resize the window back to its original size after applying a
  layout, keep it at the layout size until it must be resized (for example when
  attached and window-size is not manual).

* Add new-session -X and attach-session -x to send SIGHUP to parent when
  detaching (like detach-client -P).

* Support for octal escapes in strings (such as \007) and improve list-keys
  output so it parses correctly if copied into a configuration file.

* INCOMPATIBLE: Add a new {} syntax to the configuration file. This is a string
  similar to single quotes but also includes newlines and allows commands that
  take other commands as string arguments to be expressed more clearly and
  without additional escaping.

  A literal { and } or a string containing { or } must now be escaped or
  quoted, for example '{' and '}' instead of { or }, or 'X#{foo}' instead of
  X#{foo}.

* New <, >, <= and >= comparison operators for formats.

* Improve escaping of special characters in list-keys output.

* INCOMPATIBLE: tmux's configuration parsing has changed to use yacc(1). There
  is one incompatible change: a \ on its own must be escaped or quoted as
  either \\ or '\' (the latter works on older tmux versions).

  Entirely the same parser is now used for parsing the configuration file
  and for string commands. This means that constructs previously only
  available in .tmux.conf, such as %if, can now be used in string commands
  (for example, those given to if-shell - not commands invoked from the
  shell, they are still parsed by the shell itself).

* Add support for the overline attribute (SGR 53). The Smol capability is
  needed in terminal-overrides.

* Add the ability to create simple menus. Introduces new command
  display-menu. Default menus are bound to MouseDown3 on the status line;
  MouseDown3 or M-MouseDown3 on panes; MouseDown3 in tree, client and
  buffer modes; and C-b < and >.

* Allow panes to be empty (no command). They can be created either by piping to
  split-window -I, or by passing an empty command ('') to split-window. Output
  can be sent to an existing empty window with display-message -I.

* Add keys to jump between matching brackets (emacs C-M-f and C-M-b, vi %).

* Add a -e flag to new-window, split-window, respawn-window, respawn-pane to
  pass environment variables into the newly created process.

* Hooks are now stored in the options tree as array options, allowing them to
  have multiple separate commands. set-hook and show-hooks remain but
  set-option and show-options can now also be used (show-options will only show
  hooks if given the -H flag). Hooks with multiple commands are run in index
  order.

* Automatically scroll if dragging to create a selection with the mouse and the
  cursor reaches the top or bottom line.

* Add -no-clear variants of copy-selection and copy-pipe which do not clear the
  selection after copying. Make copy-pipe clear the selection by default to be
  consistent with copy-selection.

* Add an argument to copy commands to set the prefix for the buffer name, this
  (for example) allows buffers for different sessions to be named separately.

* Update session activity on focus event.

* Pass target from source-file into the config file parser so formats in %if
  and %endif have access to more useful variables.

* Add the ability to infer an option type (server, session, window) from its
  name to show-options (it was already present in set-option).

CHANGES FROM 2.9 TO 2.9a

* Fix bugs in select-pane and the main-horizontal and main-vertical layouts.

CHANGES FROM 2.8 TO 2.9

* Attempt to preserve horizontal cursor position as well as vertical with
  reflow.

* Rewrite main-vertical and horizontal and change layouts to better handle the
  case where all panes won't fit into the window size, reduce problems with
  pane border status lines and fix other bugs mostly found by Thomas Sattler.

* Add format variables for the default formats in the various modes
  (tree_mode_format and so on) and add a -a flag to display-message to list
  variables with values.

* Add a -v flag to display-message to show verbose messages as the format is
  parsed, this allows formats to be debugged

* Add support for HPA (\033[`).

* Add support for origin mode (\033[?6h).

* No longer clear history on RIS.

* Extend the #[] style syntax and use that together with previous format
  changes to allow the status line to be entirely configured with a single
  option.

  Now that it is possible to configure their content, enable the existing code
  that lets the status line be multiple lines in height. The status option can
  now take a value of 2, 3, 4 or 5 (as well as the previous on or off) to
  configure more than one line. The new status-format array option configures
  the format of each line, the default just references the existing status-*
  options, although some of the more obscure status options may be eliminated
  in time.

  Additions to the #[] syntax are: "align" to specify alignment (left, centre,
  right), "list" for the window list and "range" to configure ranges of text
  for the mouse bindings.

  The "align" keyword can also be used to specify alignment of entries in tree
  mode and the pane status lines.

* Add E: and T: format modifiers to expand a format twice (useful to expand the
  value of an option).

* The individual -fg, -bg and -attr options have been removed; they
  were superseded by -style options in tmux 1.9.

* Allow more than one mode to be opened in a pane. Modes are kept on a stack
  and retrieved if the same mode is entered again. Exiting the active mode goes
  back to the previous one.

* When showing command output in copy mode, call it view mode instead (affects
  pane_mode format).

* Add -b to display-panes like run-shell.

* Handle UTF-8 in word-separators option.

* New "terminal" colour allowing options to use the terminal default colour
  rather than inheriting the default from a parent option.

* Do not move the cursor in copy mode when the mouse wheel is used.

* Use the same working directory rules for jobs as new windows rather than
  always starting in the user's home.

* Allow panes to be one line or column in size.

* Go to last line when goto-line number is out of range in copy mode.

* Yank previously cut text if any with C-y in the command prompt, only use the
  buffer if no text has been cut.

* Add q: format modifier to quote shell special characters.

* Add StatusLeft and StatusRight mouse locations (keys such as
  MouseDown1StatusLeft) for the status-left and status-right areas of the
  status line.

* Add -Z to find-window.

* Support for windows larger than the client. This adds two new options,
  window-size and default-size, and a new command, resize-window. The
  force-width and force-height options and the session_width and session_height
  formats have been removed.

  The new window-size option tells tmux how to work out the size of windows:
  largest means it picks the size of the largest session, smallest the smallest
  session (similar to the old behaviour) and manual means that it does not
  automatically resize windows. aggressive-resize modifies the choice of
  session for largest and smallest as it did before.

  If a window is in a session attached to a client that is too small, only part
  of the window is shown. tmux attempts to keep the cursor visible, so the part
  of the window displayed is changed as the cursor moves (with a small delay,
  to try and avoid excess redrawing when applications redraw status lines or
  similar that are not currently visible).

  Drawing windows which are larger than the client is not as efficient as those
  which fit, particularly when the cursor moves, so it is recommended to avoid
  using this on slow machines or networks (set window-size to smallest or
  manual).

  The resize-window command can be used to resize a window manually. If it is
  used, the window-size option is automatically set to manual for the window
  (undo this with "setw -u window-size"). resize-window works in a similar way
  to resize-pane (-U -D -L -R -x -y flags) but also has -a and -A flags. -a
  sets the window to the size of the smallest client (what it would be if
  window-size was smallest) and -A the largest.

  For the same behaviour as force-width or force-height, use resize-window -x
  or -y.

  If the global window-size option is set to manual, the default-size option is
  used for new windows. If -x or -y is used with new-session, that sets the
  default-size option for the new session.

  The maximum size of a window is 10000x10000. But expect applications to
  complain and higher memory use if making a window that big. The minimum size
  is the size required for the current layout including borders.

  The refresh-client command can be used to pan around a window, -U -D -L -R
  moves up, down, left or right and -c returns to automatic cursor
  tracking. The position is reset when the current window is changed.

CHANGES FROM 2.7 TO 2.8

* Make display-panes block the client until a pane is chosen or it
  times out.

* Clear history on RIS like most other terminals do.

* Add an "Any" key to run a command if a key is pressed that is not
  bound in the current key table.

* Expand formats in load-buffer and save-buffer.

* Add a rectangle_toggle format.

* Add set-hook -R to run a hook immediately.

* Add README.ja.

* Add pane focus hooks.

* Allow any punctuation as separator for s/x/y not only /.

* Improve resizing with the mouse (fix resizing the wrong pane in some
  layouts, and allow resizing multiple panes at the same time).

* Allow , and } to be escaped in formats as #, and #}.

* Add KRB5CCNAME to update-environment.

* Change meaning of -c to display-message so the client is used if it
  matches the session given to -t.

* Fixes to : form of SGR.

* Add x and X to choose-tree to kill sessions, windows or panes.

CHANGES FROM 2.6 TO 2.7

* Remove EVENT_* variables from environment on platforms where tmux uses them
  so they do not pass on to panes.

* Fixes for hooks at server exit.

* Remove SGR 10 (was equivalent to SGR 0 but no other terminal seems to do
  this).

* Expand formats in window and session names.

* Add -Z flag to choose-tree, choose-client, choose-buffer to automatically
  zoom the pane when the mode is entered and unzoom when it exits, assuming the
  pane is not already zoomed. This is now part of the default key bindings.

* Add C-g to exit modes with emacs keys.

* Add exit-empty option to exit server if no sessions (defaults to on).

* Show if a filter is present in choose modes.

* Add pipe-pane -I to to connect stdin of the child process.

* Performance improvements for reflow.

* Use RGB terminfo(5) capability to detect RGB colour terminals (the existing
  Tc extension remains unchanged).

* Support for ISO colon-separated SGR sequences.

* Add select-layout -E to spread panes out evenly (bound to E key).

* Support wide characters properly when reflowing.

* Pass PWD to new panes as a hint to shells, as well as calling chdir().

* Performance improvements for the various choose modes.

* Only show first member of session groups in tree mode (-G flag to choose-tree
  to show all).

* Support %else in config files to match %if; from Brad Town in GitHub issue
  1071.

* Fix "kind" terminfo(5) capability to be S-Down not S-Up.

* Add a box around the preview label in tree mode.

* Show exit status and time in the remain-on-exit pane text; from Timo
  Boettcher in GitHub issue 1103.

* Correctly use pane-base-index in tree mode.

* Change the allow-rename option default to off.

* Support for xterm(1) title stack escape sequences (GitHub issue 1075 from
  Brad Town).

* Correctly remove padding cells to fix a UTF-8 display problem (GitHub issue
  1090).

CHANGES FROM 2.5 TO 2.6, 05 October 2017

* Add select-pane -T to set pane title.

* Fix memory leak when lines with BCE are removed from history.

* Fix (again) the "prefer unattached" behaviour of attach-session.

* Reorder how keys are checked to allow keys to be specified that have a
  leading escape. GitHub issue 1048.

* Support REP escape sequence (\033[b).

* Run alert hooks based on options rather than always, and allow further bells
  even if there is an existing bell.

* Add -d flag to display-panes to override display-panes-time.

* Add selection_present format when in copy mode (allows key bindings that do
  something different if there is a selection).

* Add pane_at_left, pane_at_right, pane_at_top and pane_at_bottom formats.

* Make bell, activity and silence alerting more consistent by: removing the
  bell-on-alert option; adding activity-action and silence-action options with
  the same possible values as the existing bell-action; adding a "both" value
  for the visual-bell, visual-activity and visual-silence options to trigger
  both a bell and a message.

* Add a pane_pipe format to show if pipe-pane is active.

* Block signals between forking and resetting signal handlers so that the
  libevent signal handler doesn't get called in the child and incorrectly write
  into the signal pipe that it still shares with the parent. GitHub issue 1001.

* Allow punctuation in pane_current_command.

* Add -c for respawn-pane and respawn-window.

* Wait for any remaining data to flush when a pane is closed while pipe-pane is
  in use.

* Fix working out current client with no target. GitHub issue 995.

* Try to fallback to C.UTF-8 as well as en_US.UTF-8 when looking for a UTF-8
  locale.

* Add user-keys option for user-defined key escape sequences (mapped to User0
  to User999 keys).

* Add pane-set-clipboard hook.

* FAQ file has moved out of repository to online.

* Fix problem with high CPU usage when a client dies unexpectedly. GitHub issue
  941.

* Do a dance on OS X 10.10 and above to return tmux to the user namespace,
  allowing access to the clipboard.

* Do not allow escape sequences which expect a specific terminator (APC, DSC,
  OSC) to wait for forever - use a small timeout. This reduces the chance of
  the pane locking up completely when sent garbage (cat /dev/random or
  similar).

* Support SIGUSR2 to toggle logging on a running server, also generate the
  "out" log file with -vv not -vvvv.

* Make set-clipboard a three state option: on (tmux both sends to outside
  terminal and accepts from applications inside); external (tmux sends outside
  but does not accept inside); and off.

* Fix OSC 4 palette setting for bright foreground colours. GitHub issue 954.

* Use setrgbf and setrgbb terminfo(5) capabilities to set RGB colours, if they
  are available. (Tc is still supported as well.)

* Fix redrawing panes when they are resized several times but end up with the
  size unchanged (for example, splitw/resizep -Z/breakp).

* Major rewrite of choose mode. Now includes preview, sorting, searching and
  tagging; commands that can be executed directly from the mode (for example,
  to delete one or more buffers); and filtering in tree mode.

* choose-window and choose-session are now aliases of choose-tree (in the
  command-alias option).

* Support OSC 10 and OSC 11 to set foreground and background colours.

* Check the U8 capability to determine whether to use UTF-8 line drawing
  characters for ACS.

* Some missing notifications for layout changes.

* Control mode clients now do not affect session sizes until they issue
  refresh-client -C. new-session -x and -y works with control clients even if
  the session is not detached.

* All new sessions that are unattached (whether with -d or started with no
  terminal) are now created with size 80 x 24. Whether the status line is on or
  off does not affect the size of new sessions until they are attached.

* Expand formats in option names and add -F flag to expand them in option values.

* Remember the search string for a pane even if copy mode is exited and entered
  again.

* Some further BCE fixes (scroll up, reverse index).

* Improvements to how terminals are cleared (entirely or partially).

CHANGES FROM 2.4 TO 2.5, 09 May 2017

* Reset updated flag when restarting #() command so that new output is properly
  recognised. GitHub issue 922.

* Fix ECH with a background colour.

* Do not rely on the terminal not moving the cursor after DL or EL.

* Fix send-keys and send-prefix in copy-mode (so C-b C-b works). GitHub issue
  905.

* Set the current pane for rotate-window so it works in command sequences.

* Add pane_mode format.

* Differentiate M-Up from Escape+Up when possible (that is, in terminals with
  xterm(1) style function keys). GitHub issue 907.

* Add session_stack and window_stack_index formats.

* Some new control mode notifications and corresponding hooks:
  pane-mode-changed, window-pane-changed, client-session-changed,
  session-window-changed.

* Format pane_search_string for last search term while in copy mode (useful
  with command-prompt -I).

* Fix a problem with high CPU usage and multiple clients with #(). GitHub issue
  889.

* Fix UTF-8 combining characters in column 0.

* Fix reference counting so that panes are properly destroyed and their
  processes killed.

* Clamp SU (CSI S) parameter to work around a bug in Konsole.

* Tweak line wrapping in full width panes to play more nicely with terminal
  copy and paste.

* Fix when we emit SGR 0 in capture-pane -e.

* Do not change TERM until after config file parsing has finished, so that
  commands run inside the config file can use it to make decisions (typically
  about default-terminal).

* Make the initial client wait until config file parsing has finished to avoid
  racing with commands.

* Fix core when if-shell fails.

* Only use ED to clear screen if the pane is at the bottom.

* Fix multibyte UTF-8 output.

* Code improvements around target (-t) resolution.

* Change how the default target (for commands without -t) is managed across
  command sequences: now it is set up at the start and commands are required
  to update it if needed. Fixes binding command sequences to mouse keys.

* Make if-shell from the config file work correctly.

* Change to always check the root key table if no binding is found in the
  current table (prefix table or copy-mode table or whatever). This means that
  root key bindings will take effect even in copy mode, if not overridden by a
  copy mode key binding.

* Fix so that the history file works again.

* Run config file without a client rather than using the first client, restores
  previous behaviour.

* If a #() command doesn't exit, continue to read from it and use its last full
  line of output.

* Handle slow terminals and fast output better: when the amount of data
  outstanding gets too large, discard output until it is drained and we are
  able to do a full redraw. Prevents tmux sitting on a huge buffer that the
  terminal will take forever to consume.

* Do not redraw a client unless we realistically think it can accept the data -
  defer redraws until the client has nothing else waiting to write.

CHANGES FROM 2.3 TO 2.4, 20 April 2017

Incompatible Changes
====================

* Key tables have undergone major changes. Mode key tables are no longer
  separate from the main key tables. All mode key tables have been removed,
  together with the -t flag to bind-key and unbind-key.

  The emacs-edit, vi-edit, emacs-choose and vi-choose tables have been replaced
  by fixed key bindings in the command prompt and choose modes. The mode-keys
  and status-keys options remain.

  The emacs-copy and vi-copy tables have been replaced by the copy-mode and
  copy-mode-vi tables. Commands are sent using the -X and -N flags to
  send-keys. So the following:

    bind -temacs-copy C-Up scroll-up
    bind -temacs-copy -R5 WheelUpPane scroll-up

  Becomes:

    bind -Tcopy-mode C-Up send -X scroll-up
    bind -Tcopy-mode WheelUpPane send -N5 -X scroll-up

  These changes allows the full command parser (including command sequences) and
  command set to be used - for example, the normal command prompt with editing
  and history is now used for searching, jumping, and so on instead of a custom
  one. The default C-r binding is now:

    bind -Tcopy-mode C-r command-prompt -i -p'search up' "send -X search-backward-incremental '%%'"

  There are also some new commands available with send -X, such as
  copy-pipe-and-cancel.
* set-remain-on-exit has gone -- can be achieved with hooks instead.
* Hooks: before hooks have been removed and only a selection of commands now
  have after hooks (they are no longer automatic). Additional hooks have been
  added.
* The xterm-keys option now defaults to on.

Normal Changes
==============

* Support for mouse double and triple clicks.
* BCE (Background Colour Erase) is now supported.
* All occurrences of a search string in copy mode are now highlighted;
  additionally, the number of search results is displayed. The highlighting
  updates interactively with the default emacs key bindings (incremental
  search).
* source-file now understands glob patterns.
* Formats now have simple comparisons:

    #{==:a,b}
    #{!=:a,b}

* There are the following new formats:

  - #{version} -- the tmux server version;
  - #{client_termtype} -- the terminal type of the client;
  - #{client_name} -- the name of a client;
  - #{client_written} -- the number of bytes written to the client.

* The configuration file now accepts %if/%endif conditional blocks which are
  processed when it is parsed; the argument is a format string (useful with the
  new format comparison options).
* detach-client now has -E to execute a command replacing the client instead of
  exiting.
* Add support for custom command aliases, this is an array option which
  contains items of the form "alias=command". This is consulted when an
  unknown command is parsed.
* break-pane now has -n to specify the new window name.
* OSC 52 support has been added for programs inside tmux to set a tmux buffer.
* The mouse "all event" mode (1003) is now supported.
* Palette setting is now possible (OSC 4 and 104).
* Strikethrough support (a recent terminfo is required).
* Grouped sessions can now be named (new -t).
* terminal-overrides and update-environment are now array options (the previous
  set -ag syntax should work without change).
* There have been substantial performance improvements.

CHANGES FROM 2.2 TO 2.3, 29 September 2016

Incompatible Changes
====================

None.

Normal Changes
==============

* New option 'pane-border-status' to add text in the pane borders.
* Support for hooks on commands: 'after' and 'before' hooks.
* 'source-file' understands '-q' to suppress errors for nonexistent files.
* Lots of UTF8 improvements, especially on MacOS.
* 'window-status-separator' understands #[] expansions.
* 'split-window' understands '-f' for performing a full-width split.
* Allow report count to be specified when using 'bind-key -R'.
* 'set -a' for appending to user options (@foo) is now supported.
* 'display-panes' can now accept a command to run, rather than always
  selecting the pane.

CHANGES FROM 2.1 TO 2.2, 10 April 2016

Incompatible Changes
====================

* The format strings which referenced time have been removed.  Instead:

  #{t:window_activity}

can be used.

* Support for TMPDIR has been removed.  Use TMUX_TMPDIR instead.
* UTF8 detection now happens automatically if the client supports it, hence
  the:

  mouse-utf8
  utf8

  options has been removed.
* The:

  mouse_utf8_flag

  format string has been removed.
* The -I option to show-messages has been removed.  See:

  #{t:start_time}

  format option instead.

Normal Changes
==============

* Panes are unzoomed with selectp -LRUD
* New formats added:

  #{scroll_position}
  #{socket_path}
  #{=10:...} -- limit to N characters (from the start)
  #{=-10:...} -- limit to N characters (from the end)
  #{t:...} -- used to format time-based formats
  #{b:...} -- used to ascertain basename from string
  #{d:...} -- used to ascertain dirname from string
  #{s:...} -- used to perform substitutions on a string

* Job output is run via the format system, so formats work again
* If display-time is set to 0, then the indicators wait for a key to be
  pressed.
* list-keys and list-commands can be run without starting the tmux server.
* kill-session learns -C to clear all alerts in all windows of the session.
* Support for hooks (internal for now), but hooks for the following have been
  implemented:

  alert-bell
  alert-silence
  alert-activity
  client-attached
  client-detached
  client-resized
  pane-died
  pane-exited

* RGB (24bit) colour support.  The 'Tc' flag must be set in the external TERM
  entry (using terminal-overrides or a custom terminfo entry).

CHANGES FROM 2.0 TO 2.1, 18 October 2015

Incompatible Changes
====================

* Mouse-mode has been rewritten.  There's now no longer options for:
	- mouse-resize-pane
	- mouse-select-pane
	- mouse-select-window
	- mode-mouse

  Instead there is just one option:  'mouse' which turns on mouse support
  entirely.
* 'default-terminal' is now a session option.  Furthermore, if this is set
  to 'screen-*' then emulate what screen does.  If italics are wanted, this
  can be set to 'tmux' but this is still new and not necessarily supported
  on all platforms with older ncurses installs.
* The c0-* options for rate-limiting have been removed.  Instead, a backoff
  approach is used.

Normal Changes
==============

* New formats:
	- session_activity
	- window_linked
	- window_activity_format
	- session_alerts
	- session_last_attached
	- client_pid
	- pid
* 'copy-selection', 'append-selection', 'start-named-buffer' now understand
  an '-x' flag to prevent it exiting copying mode.
* 'select-pane' now understands '-P' to set window/pane background colours.
* 'renumber-windows' now understands windows which are unlinked.
* 'bind' now understands multiple key tables.  Allows for key-chaining.
* 'select-layout' understands '-o' to undo the last layout change.
* The environment is updated when switching sessions as well as attaching.
* 'select-pane' now understands '-M' for marking a pane.  This marked pane
  can then be used with commands which understand src-pane specifiers
  automatically.
* If a session/window target is prefixed with '=' then only an exact match
  is considered.
* 'move-window' understands '-a'.
* 'update-environment' understands '-E' when attach-session is used on an
  already attached client.
* 'show-environment' understands '-s' to output Bourne-compatible commands.
* New option: 'history-file' to save/restore command prompt history.
* Copy mode is exited if the history is cleared whilst in copy-mode.
* 'copy-mode' learned '-e' to exit copy-mode when scrolling to end.

CHANGES FROM 1.9a TO 2.0, 06 March 2015

Incompatible Changes
====================

* The choose-list command has been removed.
* 'terminal-overrides' is now a server option, not a session option.
* 'message-limit' is now a server option, not a session option.
* 'monitor-content' option has been removed.
* 'pane_start_path' option has been removed.
* The "info" mechanism which used to (for some commands) provide feedback
  has been removed, and like other commands, they now produce nothing on
  success.

Normal Changes
==============

* tmux can now write an entry to utmp if the library 'utempter' is present
  at compile time.
* set-buffer learned append mode (-a), and a corresponding
  'append-selection' command has been added to copy-mode.
* choose-mode now has the following commands which can be bound:
	- start-of-list
	- end-of-list
	- top-line
	- bottom-line

* choose-buffer now understands UTF-8.
* Pane navigation has changed:
	- The old way of always using the top or left if the choice is ambiguous.
	- The new way of remembering the last used pane is annoying if the
	  layout is balanced and the leftmost is obvious to the user (because
	  clearly if we go right from the top-left in a tiled set of four we want
	  to end up in top-right, even if we were last using the bottom-right).

      So instead, use a combination of both: if there is only one possible
      pane alongside the current pane, move to it, otherwise choose the most
      recently used of the choice.
* 'set-buffer' can now be told to give names to buffers.
* The 'new-session', 'new-window', 'split-window', and 'respawn-pane' commands
  now understand multiple arguments and handle quoting problems correctly.
* 'capture-pane' understands '-S-' to mean the start of the pane, and '-E-' to
  mean the end of the pane.
* Support for function keys beyond F12 has changed.  The following explains:
	- F13-F24 are S-F1 to S-F12
	- F25-F36 are C-F1 to C-F12
	- F37-F48 are C-S-F1 to C-S-F12
	- F49-F60 are M-F1 to M-F12
	- F61-F63 are M-S-F1 to M-S-F3

 Therefore, F13 becomes a binding of S-F1, etc.
* Support using pane id as part of session or window specifier (so % means
  session-of-%1 or window-of-%1) and window id as part of session
  (so @1 means session-of-@1).
* 'copy-pipe' command now understands formats via -F
* 'if-shell'  command now understands formats via -F
* 'split-window' and 'join-window' understand -b to create the pane to the left
  or above the target pane.

CHANGES FROM 1.9 TO 1.9a, 22 February 2014

NOTE: This is a bug-fix release to address some important bugs which just
missed the 1.9 deadline, but were found afterwards.

Normal Changes
==============

* Fix crash due to uninitialized lastwp member of layout_cell
* Fix -fg/-bg/-style with 256 colour terminals.

CHANGES FROM 1.8 TO 1.9, 20 February 2014

NOTE:  This release has bumped the tmux protocol version.  It is therefore
advised that the prior tmux server is restarted when this version of tmux is
installed, to avoid protocol mismatch errors for newer clients trying to
talk to an older running tmux server.

Incompatible Changes
====================

* 88 colour support has been removed.
* 'default-path' has been removed.  The new-window command accepts '-c' to
  cater for this.  The previous value of "." can be replaced with: 'neww -c
  $PWD', the previous value of '' which meant current path of the pane can
  be specified as:  'neww -c "#{pane_current_path}"'

Deprecated Changes
==================

* The single format specifiers:  #A -> #Z (where defined) have been
  deprecated and replaced with longer-named equivalents, as listed in the
  FORMATS section of the tmux manpage.
* The various foo-{fg,bg,attr} commands have been deprecated and replaced
  with equivalent foo-style option instead.  Currently this is still
  backwards-compatible, but will be removed over time.

Normal Changes
==============

* A new environment variable TMUX_TMPDIR is now honoured, allowing the
  socket directory to be set outside of TMPDIR (/tmp/ if not set).
* If -s not given to swap-pane the current pane is assumed.
* A #{pane_synchronized} format specifier has been added to be a conditional
  format if a pane is in a synchronised mode (c.f. synchronize-panes)
* Tmux now runs under Cygwin natively.
* Formats can now be nested within each other and expanded accordingly.
* Added 'automatic-rename-format' option to allow the automatic rename
  mechanism to use something other than the default of
  #{pane_current_command}.
* new-session learnt '-c' to specify the starting directory for that session
  and all subsequent windows therein.
* The session name is now shown in the message printed to the terminal when
  a session is detached.
* Lots more format specifiers have been added.
* Server race conditions have been fixed; in particular commands are not run
  until after the configuration file is read completely.
* Case insensitive searching in tmux's copy-mode is now possible.
* attach-session and switch-client learnt the '-t' option to accept a window
  and/or a pane to use.
* Copy-mode is only exited if no selection is in progress.
* Paste key in copy-mode is now possible to enter text from the clipboard.
* status-interval set to '0' now works as intended.
* tmux now supports 256 colours running under fbterm.
* Many bug fixes!

CHANGES FROM 1.7 TO 1.8, 26 March 2013

Incompatible Changes
====================

* layout redo/undo has been removed.

Normal Changes
==============

* Add halfpage up/down bindings to copy mode.
* Session choosing fixed to work with unattached sessions.
* New window options window-status-last-{attr,bg,fg} to denote the last
  window which was active.
* Scrolling in copy-mode now scrolls the region without moving the mouse
  cursor.
* run-shell learnt '-t' to specify the pane to use when displaying output.
* Support for middle-click pasting.
* choose-tree learns '-u' to start uncollapsed.
* select-window learnt '-T' to toggle to the last window if it's already
  current.
* New session option 'assume-paste-time' for pasting text versus key-binding
  actions.
* choose-* commands now work outside of an attached client.
* Aliases are now shown for list-commands command.
* Status learns about formats.
* Free-form options can be set with set-option if prepended with an '@'
  sign.
* capture-pane learnt '-p' to send to stdout, and '-e' for capturing escape
  sequences, and '-a' to capture the alternate screen, and '-P' to dump
  pending output.
* Many new formats added (client_session, client_last_session, etc.)
* Control mode, which is a way for a client to send tmux commands.
  Currently more useful to users of iterm2.
* resize-pane learnt '-x' and '-y' for absolute pane sizing.
* Config file loading now reports errors from all files which are loaded via
  the 'source-file' command.
* 'copy-pipe' mode command to copy selection and pipe the selection to a
  command.
* Panes can now emit focus notifications for certain applications
  which use those.
* run-shell and if-shell now accept formats.
* resize-pane learnt '-Z' for zooming a pane temporarily.
* new-session learnt '-A' to make it behave like attach-session.
* set-option learnt '-o' to prevent setting an option which is already set.
* capture-pane and show-options learns '-q' to silence errors.
* New command 'wait-for' which blocks a client until woken up again.
* Resizing panes will now reflow the text inside them.
* Lots and lots of bug fixes, fixing memory-leaks, etc.
* Various manpage improvements.

CHANGES FROM 1.6 TO 1.7, 13 October 2012

* tmux configuration files now support line-continuation with a "\" at the
  end of a line.
* New option status-position to move the status line to the top or bottom of
  the screen.
* Enforce history-limit option when clearing the screen.
* Give each window a unique id, like panes but prefixed with @.
* Add pane id to each pane in layout description (while still accepting
  the old form).
* Provide defined ways to set the various default-path possibilities: ~
  for home directory, . for server start directory, - for session start
  directory and empty for the pane's working directory (the default). All
  can also be used as part of a relative path (eg -/foo). Also provide -c
  flags to neww and splitw to override default-path setting.
* Add -l flag to send-keys to send input literally (without translating
  key names).
* Allow a single option to be specified to show-options to show just that
  option.
* New command "move-pane" (like join-pane but allows the same window).
* join-pane and move-pane commands learn "-b" option to place the pane to
  the left or above.
* Support for bracketed-paste mode.
* Allow send-keys command to accept hex values.
* Add locking around "start-server" to avoid race-conditions.
* break-pane learns -P/-F arguments for display formatting.
* set-option learns "-q" to make it quiet, and not print out anything.
* copy mode learns "wrap-search" option.
* Add a simple form of output rate limiting by counting the number of
  certain C0 sequences (linefeeds, backspaces, carriage returns) and if it
  exceeds a threshold (current default 250/millisecond), start to redraw
  the pane every 100 milliseconds instead of making each change as it
  comes. Two configuration options - c0-change-trigger and
  c0-change-interval.
* find-window learns new flags:  "-C", "-N", "-T" to match against either or
  all of a window's content, name, or title.  Defaults to all three options
  if none specified.
* find-window automatically selects the appropriate pane for the found
  matches.
* show-environment can now accept one option to show that environment value.
* Exit mouse mode when end-of-screen reached when scrolling with the mouse
  wheel.
* select-layout learns -u and -U for layout history stacks.

  killing all but the current thing specified.
* move-window learns "-r" option to renumber window sequentially in a
  session.
* New session option "renumber-windows" to automatically renumber windows in
  a session when a window is closed.  (see "move-window -r").
* Only enter copy-mode on scroll up.
* choose-* and list-* commands all use "-F" for format specifiers.
* When spawning external commands, the value from the "default-shell" option
  is now used, rather than assuming /bin/sh.
* New choose-tree command to render window/sessions as a tree for selection.
* display-message learns new format options.
* For linked-windows across sessions, all flags for that window are now
  cleared across sessions.
* Lots and lots of bug fixes, fixing memory-leaks, etc.
* Various manpage improvements.

CHANGES FROM 1.5 TO 1.6, 23 January 2012

* Extend the mode-mouse option to add a third choice which means the mouse
  does not enter copy mode.
* Add a -r flag to switch-client to toggle the client read-only flag.
* Add pane-base-index option.
* Support \ for line continuation in the configuration file.
* Framework for more powerful formatting of command output and use it for
  list-{panes,windows,sessions}. This allows more descriptive replacements
  (such as #{session_name}) and conditionals.
* Mark dead panes with some text saying they are dead.
* Reject $SHELL if it is not a full path.
* Add -S option to refresh-client to redraw status line.
* Add an else clause for if-shell.
* Try to resolve relative paths for loadb and saveb (first, using client
  working directory, if any, then default-path or session working directory).
* Support for \e[3J to clear the history and send the corresponding
  terminfo code (E3) before locking.
* When in copy mode, make repeat count indicate buffer to replace, if used.
* Add screen*:XT to terminal-overrides for tmux-in-tmux.
* Status-line message attributes added.
* Move word-separators to be a session rather than window option.
* Change the way the working directory for new processes is discovered. If
  default-path isn't empty, it is used. Otherwise, if a new window is created
  from the command-line, the working directory of the client is used. If not,
  platform specific code is used to retrieve the current working directory
  of the process in the active pane. If that fails, the directory where the
  session was created is used, instead.
* Do not change the current pane if both mouse-select-{pane,window} are
  enabled.
* Add \033[s and \033[u to save and restore cursor position.
* Allow $HOME to be used as default-path.
* Add CNL and CPL escape sequences.
* Calculate last position correctly for UTF-8 wide characters.
* Add an option allow-rename to disable the window rename escape sequence.
* Attributes for each type of status-line alert (ie bell, content and
  activity) added. Therefore, remove the superfluous options
  window-status-alert-{attr,bg,fg}.
* Add a -R flag to send-keys to reset the terminal.
* Add strings to allow the aixterm bright colours to be used when
  configuring colours.
* Drop the ability to have a list of keys in the prefix in favour of two
  separate options, prefix and prefix2.
* Flag -2 added to send-prefix to send the secondary prefix key.
* Show pane size in top right of display panes mode.
* Some memory leaks plugged.
* More command-prompt editing improvements.
* Various manpage improvements.
* More Vi mode improvements.

CHANGES FROM 1.4 TO 1.5, 09 July 2011

* Support xterm mouse modes 1002 and 1003.
* Change from a per-session stack of buffers to one global stack. This renders
  copy-buffer useless and makes buffer-limit now a server option.
* Fix most-recently-used choice by avoiding reset the activity timer for
  unattached sessions every second.
* Add a -P option to new-window and split-window to print the new window or
  pane index in target form (useful to pass it into other commands).
* Handle a # at the end of a replacement string (such as status-left)
  correctly.
* Support for UTF-8 mouse input (\033[1005h) which was added in xterm 262.
  If the new mouse-utf8 option is on, UTF-8 mouse input is enabled for all
  UTF-8 terminals. The option defaults to on if LANG etc are set in the same
  manner as the utf8 option.
* Support for HP-UX.
* Accept colours of the hex form #ffffff and translate to the nearest from the
  xterm(1) 256-colour set.
* Clear the non-blocking IO flag (O_NONBLOCK) on the stdio file descriptors
  before closing them (fixes things like "tmux ls && cat").
* Use TMPDIR if set.
* Fix next and previous session functions to actually work.
* Support -x and -y for new-session to specify the initial size of the window
  if created detached with -d.
* Make bind-key accept characters with the top-bit-set and print them as octal.
* Set $TMUX without the session when background jobs are run.
* Simplify the way jobs work and drop the persist type, so all jobs are
  fire-and-forget.
* Accept tcgetattr/tcsetattr(3) failure, fixes problems with fatal() if the
  terminal disappears while locked.
* Add a -P option to detach to HUP the client's parent process (usually causing
  it to exit as well).
* Support passing through escape sequences to the underlying terminal by using
  DCS with a "tmux;" prefix.
* Prevent tiled producing a corrupt layout when only one column is needed.
* Give each pane created in a tmux server a unique id (starting from 0), put it
  in the TMUX_PANE environment variable and accept it as a target.
* Allow a start and end line to be specified for capture-pane which may be
  negative to capture part of the history.
* Add -a and -s options to lsp to list all panes in the server or session
  respectively. Likewise add -s to lsw.
* Change -t on display-message to be target-pane for the #[A-Z] replacements
  and add -c as target-client.
* The attach-session command now prefers the most recently used unattached
  session.
* Add -s option to detach-client to detach all clients attached to a session.
* Add -t to list-clients.
* Change window with mouse wheel over status line if mouse-select-window is on.
* When mode-mouse is on, automatically enter copy mode when the mouse is
  dragged or the mouse wheel is used. Also exit copy mode when the mouse wheel
  is scrolled off the bottom.
* Provide #h character pair for short hostname (no domain).
* Don't use strnvis(3) for the title as it breaks UTF-8.
* Use the tsl and fsl terminfo(5) capabilities to update terminal title and
  automatically fill them in on terminals with the XT capability (which means
  their title setting is xterm-compatible).
* Add a new option, mouse-resize-pane. When on, panes may be resized by
  dragging their borders.
* Fix crash by resetting last pane on {break,swap}-pane across windows.
* Add three new copy-mode commands - select-line, copy-line, copy-end-of-line.
* Support setting the xterm clipboard when copying from copy mode using the
  xterm escape sequence for the purpose (if xterm is configured to allow it).
* Support xterm(1) cursor colour change sequences through terminfo(5) Cc
  (set) and Cr (reset) extensions.
* Support DECSCUSR sequence to set the cursor style with two new terminfo(5)
  extensions, Cs and Csr.
* Make the command-prompt custom prompts recognize the status-left option
  character pairs.
* Add a respawn-pane command.
* Add a couple of extra xterm-style keys that gnome terminal provides.
* Allow the initial context on prompts to be set with the new -I option to
  command-prompt. Include the current window and session name in the prompt
  when renaming and add a new key binding ($) for rename session.
* Option bell-on-alert added to trigger the terminal bell when there is an
  alert.
* Change the list-keys format so that it shows the keys using actual tmux
  commands which should be able to be directly copied into the config file.
* Show full targets for lsp/lsw -a.
* Make confirm-before prompt customizable with -p option like command-prompt
  and add the character pairs #W and #P to the default kill-{pane,window}
  prompts.
* Avoid sending data to suspended/locked clients.
* Small memory leaks in error paths plugged.
* Vi mode improvements.

CHANGES FROM 1.3 TO 1.4, 27 December 2010

* Window bell reporting fixed.
* Show which pane is active in the list-panes output.
* Backoff reworked.
* Prevent the server from dying when switching into copy mode when already
  in a different mode.
* Reset running jobs when the status line is enabled or disabled.
* Simplify xterm modifier detection.
* Avoid crashing in copy mode if the screen size is too small for the
  indicator.
* Flags -n and -p added to switch-client.
* Use UTF-8 line drawing characters on UTF-8 terminals, thus fixing some
  terminals (eg putty) which disable the vt100 ACS mode switching sequences
  in UTF-8 mode. On terminals without ACS, use ASCII equivalents.
* New server option exit-unattached added.
* New session option destroy-unattached added.
* Fall back on normal session choice method if $TMUX exists but is invalid
  rather than rejecting.
* Mark repeating keys with "(repeat)" in the key list.
* When removing a pane, don't change the active pane unless the active pane
  is actually the one being removed.
* New command last-pane added.
* AIX fixes.
* Flag -a added to unbind-key.
* Add XAUTHORITY to update-environment.
* More info regarding window and pane flags is now shown in list-*.
* If VISUAL or EDITOR contains "vi" configure mode-keys and status-key to vi.
* New window option monitor-silence and session option visual-silence added.
* In the built-in layouts distribute the panes more evenly.
* Set the default value of main-pane-width to 80 instead of 81.
* Command-line flag -V added.
* Instead of keeping a per-client prompt history make it global.
* Fix rectangle copy to behave like emacs (the cursor is not part of the
  selection on the right edge but on the left it is).
* Flag -l added to switch-client.
* Retrieve environment variables from the global environment rather than
  getenv(3), thus allowing them to be updated during the configuration file.
* New window options other-pane-{height,width} added.
* More minor bugs fixed and manpage improvements.

CHANGES FROM 1.2 TO 1.3, 18 July 2010

* New input parser.
* Flags to move through panes -UDLR added to select-pane.
* Commands up-pane, and down-pane removed, since equivalent behaviour is now
  available through the target flag (-t:+ and -t:-).
* Jump-forward/backward in copy move (based on vi's F, and f commands).
* Make paste-buffer accept a pane as a target.
* Flag -a added to new-window to insert a window after an existing one, moving
  windows up if necessary.
* Merge more mode into copy mode.
* Run job commands explicitly in the global environment (which can be modified
  with setenv -g), rather than with the environment tmux started with.
* Use the machine's hostname as the default title, instead of an empty string.
* Prevent double free if the window option remain-on-exit is set.
* Key string conversions rewritten.
* Mark zombie windows as dead in the choose-window list.
* Tiled layout added.
* Signal handling reworked.
* Reset SIGCHLD after fork to fix problems with some shells.
* Select-prompt command removed. Therefore, bound ' to command-prompt -p index
  "select-window -t:%%" by default.
* Catch SIGHUP and terminate if running as a client, thus avoiding clients from
  being left hanging around when, for instance, a SSH session is disconnected.
* Solaris 9 fixes (such as adding compat {get,set}env(3) code).
* Accept none instead of default for attributes.
* Window options window-status-alert-{alert,bg,fg} added.
* Flag -s added to the paste-buffer command to specify a custom separator.
* Allow dragging to make a selection in copy mode if the mode-mouse option is
  set.
* Support the mouse scroll wheel.
* Make pipe-pane accept special character sequences (eg #I).
* Fix problems with window sizing when starting tmux from .xinitrc.
* Give tmux sockets (but not the containing folder) group permissions.
* Extend the target flags (ie -t) to accept an offset (for example -t:+2), and
  make it wrap windows, and panes.
* New command choose-buffer added.
* New server option detach-on-destroy to set what happens to a client when the
  session it is attached to is destroyed. If on (default), the client is
  detached. Otherwise, the client is switched to the most recently active of
  the remaining sessions.
* The commands load-buffer, and save-buffer now accept a dash (-) as the file
  to read from stdin, or write to stdout.
* Custom layouts added.
* Additional code reduction, bug fixes, and manpage enhancements.

CHANGES FROM 1.1 TO 1.2, 10 March 2010

* Switch to libevent.
* Emulate the ri (reverse index) capability, ergo allowing tmux to at least
  start on Sun consoles (TERM=sun, or sun-color).
* Assign each entry a number, or lowercase letter in choose mode, and accept
  that as a shortcut key.
* Permit top-bit-set characters to be entered in the status line.
* Mark no-prefix keys with (no prefix), rather than [] in list-keys.
* New command show-messages (alias showmsgs), and new session option
  message-limit, to show a per-client log of status lines messages up to the
  number defined by message-limit.
* Do not interpret #() for display-message to avoid leaking commands.
* New window options window-status-format, and window-status-current-format to
  control the format of each window in the status line.
* Add a -p flag to display-message to print the output, instead of displaying
  it in the status line.
* Emulate il1, dl1, ich1 to run with vt100 feature set.
* New command capture-pane (alias capturep) to copy the entire pane contents
  to a paste buffer.
* Avoid duplicating code by adding a -w flag to set-option, and show-options to
  set, and show window options. The commands set-window-option, and
  show-window-options are now aliases.
* Panes can now be referred to as top, bottom, top-left, etc.
* Add server-wide options, which can be set with set-option -s, and shown with
  show-options -s.
* New server option quiet (like -q from the command line).
* New server option escape-time to set the timeout used to detect if escapes
  are alone, part of a function key, or meta sequence.
* New session options pane-active-border-bg, pane-active-border-fg,
  pane-border-bg, and pane-border-fg to set pane colours.
* Make split-window accept a pane target, instead of a window.
* New command join-pane (alias joinp) to split, and move an existing pane into
  the space (the opposite of break-pane), thus simplifying calls to
  split-window, followed by move-window.
* Permit S- prefix on keys for shift when the terminal/terminfo supports them.
* Window targets (-t flag) can now refer to the last window (!), next (+), and
  previous (-) window by number.
* Mode keys to jump to the bottom/top of history, end of the next word, scroll
  up/down, and reverse search in copy mode.
* New session option display-panes-active-colour to display the active pane in
  a different colour with the display-panes command.
* Read the socket path from $TMUX if it's present, and -L, and -S are not
  given.
* Vi-style mode keys B, W, and E to navigate between words in copy mode.
* Start in more mode when configuration file errors are detected.
* Rectangle copy support added.
* If attach-session was specified with the -r flag, make the client read-only.
* Per-window alternate-screen option.
* Make load-buffer work with FIFOs.
* New window option word-separators to set the characters considered as word
  separators in copy mode.
* Permit keys in copy mode to be prefixed by a repeat count, entered with [1-9]
  in vi mode, or M-[1-9] in emacs mode.
* utf8 improvements.
* As usual, additional code reduction, bug fixes, and manpage enhancements.

CHANGES FROM 1.0 TO 1.1, 05 November 2009

* New run-shell (alias run) command to run an external command without a
  window, capture it's stdout, and send it to output mode.
* Ability to define multiple prefix keys.
* Internal locking mechanism removed. Instead, detach each client and run the
  external command specified in the new session option lock-command (by default
  lock -np), thus allowing the system password to be used.
* set-password command, and -U command line flag removed per the above change.
* Add support for -c command line flag to execute a shell command.
* New lock-client (alias lockc), and lock-session (alias locks) commands to
  lock a particular client, or all clients attached to a session.
* Support C-n/C-p/C-v/M-v with emacs keys in choice mode.
* Use : for goto line rather than g in vi mode.
* Try to guess which client to use when no target client was specified. Finds
  the current session, and if only one client is present, use it. Otherwise,
  return the most recently used client.
* Make C-Down/C-Up in copy mode scroll the screen down/up one line without
  moving the cursor.
* Scroll mode superseded by copy mode.
* New synchronize-panes window option to send all input to all other panes in
  the same window.
* New lock-server session option to lock, when off (on by default), each
  session when it has been idle for the lock-after-time setting. When on, the
  entire server locks when all sessions have been idle for their individual
  lock-after-time setting.
* Add support for grouped sessions which have independent name, options,
  current window, but where the linked windows are synchronized (ie creating,
  killing windows are mirrored between the sessions). A grouped session may be
  created by passing -t to new-session.
* New mouse-select-pane session option to select the current pane with the
  mouse.
* Queue, and run commands in the background for if-shell, status-left,
  status-right, and #() by starting each once every status-interval. Adds the
  capability to call some programs which would previously cause the server to
  hang (eg sleep/tmux). It also avoids running commands excessively (ie if used
  multiple times, it will be run only once).
* When a window is zombified and automatic-rename is on, append [dead] to the
  name.
* Split list-panes (alias lsp) off from list-windows.
* New pipe-pane (alias pipep) to redirect a pane output to an external command.
* Support for automatic-renames for Solaris.
* Permit attributes to be turned off in #[] by prefixing with no (eg nobright).
* Add H/M/L in vi mode, and M-R/M-r in emacs to move the cursor to the top,
  middle, and bottom of the screen.
* -a option added to kill-pane to kill all except current pane.
* The -d command line flag is now gone (can be replaced by terminal-overrides).
  Just use op/AX to detect default colours.
* input/tty/utf8 improvements.
* xterm-keys rewrite.
* Additional code reduction, and bug fixes.

CHANGES FROM 0.9 TO 1.0, 20 September 2009

* Option to alter the format of the window title set by tmux.
* Backoff for a while after multiple incorrect password attempts.
* Quick display of pane numbers (C-b q).
* Better choose-window, choose-session commands and a new choose-client command.
* Option to request multiple responses when using command-prompt.
* Improved environment handling.
* Combine wrapped lines when pasting.
* Option to override terminal settings (terminal-overrides).
* Use the full range of ACS characters for drawing pane separator lines.
* Customisable mode keys.
* Status line colour options, with embedded colours in status-left/right, and
  an option to centre the window list.
* Much improved layouts, including both horizontal and vertical splitting.
* Optional visual bell, activity and content indications.
* Set the utf8 and status-utf8 options when the server is started with -u.
* display-message command to show a message in the status line, by default some
  information about the current window.
* Improved current process detection on NetBSD.
* unlink-window -k is now the same as kill-window.
* attach-session now works from inside tmux.
* A system-wide configuration file, /etc/tmux.conf.
* A number of new commands in copy mode, including searching.
* Panes are now specified using the target (-t) notation.
* -t now accepts fnmatch(3) patterns and looks for prefixes.
* Translate \r into \n when pasting.
* Support for binding commands to keys without the prefix key
* Support for alternate screen (terminfo smcup/rmcup).
* Maintain data that goes off screen after reducing the window size, so it can
  be restored when the size is increased again.
* New if-shell command to test a shell command before running a tmux command.
* tmux now works as the shell.
* Man page reorganisation.
* Many minor additions, much code tidying and several bug fixes.

CHANGES FROM 0.8 TO 0.9, 01 July 2009

* Major changes to build infrastructure: cleanup of makefiles and addition
  of a configure script.
* monitor-content window option to monitor a window for a specific fnmatch(3)
  pattern. The find-window command also now accepts fnmatch(3) patterns.
* previous-layout and select-layout commands, and a main-horizontal layout.
* Recreate the server socket on SIGUSR1.
* clear-history command.
* Use ACS line drawing characters for pane separator lines.
* UTF-8 improvements, and code to detect UTF-8 support by looking at
  environment variables.
* The resize-pane-up and resize-pane-down commands are now merged together
  into a new resize-pane command with -U and -D flags.
* confirm-before command to request a yes/no answer before executing dangerous
  commands.
* Status line bug fixes, support for UTF-8 (status-utf8 option), and a key to
  paste from the paste buffer.
* Support for some additional escape sequences and terminal features, including
  better support for insert mode and tab stops.
* Improved window resizing behaviour, modelled after xterm.
* Some code reduction and a number of miscellaneous bug fixes.

================================================================================

On 01 June 2009, tmux was imported into the OpenBSD base system. From this date
onward changes are logged as part of the normal CVS commit message to either
OpenBSD or SourceForge CVS. This file will be updated to contain a summary of
major changes with each release, and to mention important configuration or
command syntax changes during development.

The list of older changes is below.

================================================================================

21 May 2009

* stat(2) files before trying to load them to avoid problems, for example
  with "source-file /dev/zero".

19 May 2009

* Try to guess if the window is UTF-8 by outputting a three-byte UTF-8 wide
  character and seeing how much the cursor moves. Currently tries to figure out
  if this works by some stupid checks on the terminal, these need to be
  rethought. Also might be better using a width 1 character rather than width 2.
* If LANG contains "UTF-8", assume the terminal supports UTF-8, on the grounds
  that anyone who configures it probably wants UTF-8. Not certain if this is
  a perfect idea but let's see if it causes any problems.
* New window option: monitor-content. Searches for a string in a window and if
  it matches, highlight the status line.

18 May 2009

* main-horizontal layout and main-pane-height option to match vertical.
* New window option main-pane-width to set the width of the large left pane with
  main-vertical (was left-vertical) layout.
* Lots of layout cleanup. manual layout is now manual-vertical.

16 May 2009

* select-layout command and a few default key bindings (M-0, M-1, M-2, M-9) to
  select layouts.
* Recreate server socket on SIGUSR1, per SF feature request 2792533.

14 May 2009

* Keys in status line (p in vi mode, M-y in emacs) to paste the first line
  of the upper paste buffer. Suggested by Dan Colish.
* clear-history command to clear a pane's history.
* Don't force wrapping with \n when asked, let the cursor code figure it out.
  Should fix terminals which use this to detect line breaks.
* Major cleanup and restructuring of build infrastructure. Still separate files
  for GNU and BSD make, but they are now hugely simplified at the expense of
  adding a configure script which must be run before make. Now build and
  install with:

	$ ./configure && make && sudo make install

04 May 2009

* Use ACS line drawing characters for pane separator lines.

30 April 2009

* Support command sequences without a space before the semicolon, for example
  "neww; neww" now works as well as "neww ; neww". "neww;neww" is still an
  error.
* previous-layout command.
* Display the layout name in window lists.
* Merge resize-pane-up and resize-pane-down into resize-pane with -U and -D
  flags.

29 April 2009

* Get rid of compat/vis.* - only one function was used which is easily
  replaced,and less compat code == good.

27 April 2009

* Avoid using the prompt history when the server is locked, and prevent any
  input entered from being added to the client's prompt history.
* New command, confirm-before (alias confirm), which asks for confirmation
  before executing a command. Bound "&" and "x" by default to confirm-before
  "kill-window" and confirm-before "kill-pane", respectively.

23 April 2009

* Support NEL, yet another way of making newline. Fixes the output from some
  Gentoo packaging thing. Reported by someone on SF then logs that allowed a
  fix sent by tcunha.
* Use the xenl terminfo flag to detect early-wrap terminals like the FreeBSD
  console. Many thanks for a very informative email from Christian Weisgerber.

21 April 2009

* tmux 0.8 released.

17 April 2009

* Remove the right number of characters from the buffer when escape then
  a cursor key (or other key prefixed by \033) is pressed. Reported by
  Stuart Henderson.

03 April 2009

* rotate-window command. -U flag (default) for up, -D flag for down.

02 April 2009

* Change scroll/pane redraws to only redraw the single pane affected rather
  than the entire window.
* If redrawing the region would mean redrawing > half the pane, just schedule
  to redraw the entire window. Also add a flag to skip updating the window any
  further if it is scheduled to be redrawn. This has the effect of batching
  multiple redraws together.

01 April 2009

* Basic horizontal splitting and layout management. Still some redraw and other
  issues - particularly, don't mix with manual pane resizing, be careful when
  viewing from multiple clients and don't expect shell windows to redraw very
  well after the layout is changed; generally cycling the layout a few times
  will fix most problems. Getting this in for testing while I think about how
  to deal with manual mode.

  Split window as normal and cycle the layouts with C-b space. Some of the
  layouts will work better when swap-pane comes along.

31 March 2009

* AIX port, thanks to cmihai for access to a box. Only tested on 6.1 with xlc
  10.1 (make sure CC is set). Needs GNU make and probably ncurses (didn't try
  plain curses). Also won't build with DEBUG, so comment the FDEBUG=1 line in
  GNUmakefile.
* Draw a vertical line on the right when the window size is less than the
  terminal size. This is partly to shake out any horizontal limit bugs on the
  way to horizontal splitting/pane tiling. Currently a bit slow since it has to
  do a lot of redrawing but hopefully that will improve as I get some better
  ideas for how to do it.
* Fix remaining problems with copy and paste and UTF-8.

28 March 2009

* Better UTF-8 support, including combined characters. Unicode data is now
  stored as UTF-8 in a separate array, the code does a lookup into this every
  time it gets to a UTF-8 cell. Zero width characters are just appended onto
  the UTF-8 data for the previous cell. This also means that almost no bytes
  extra are wasted non-Unicode data (yay).

  Still some oddities, such as copy mode skips over wide characters in a
  strange way, and the code could do with some tidying.
* Key repeating is now a property of the key binding not of the command.
  Repeat is turned on when the key is bound with the -r flag to bind-key.
  next/previous-window no longer repeat by default as it turned out to annoy
  me.

27 March 2009

* Clear using ED when redrawing the screen. I foolishly assumed using spaces
  would be equivalent and terminals would pick up on this, but apparently not.
  This fixes copy and paste in xterm/rxvt.
* Sockets in /tmp are now created in a subdirectory named, tmux-UID, eg
  tmux-1000. The default socket is thus /tmp/tmux-UID/default. To start a
  separate server, the new -L command line option should be used: this creates
  a socket in the same directory with a different name ("-L main" will create
  socket called "main"). -S should only be used to place the socket outside
  /tmp. This makes sockets a little more secure and a bit more convenient to
  use multiple servers.

21 March 2009

* New session flag "set-remain-on-exit" to set remain-on-exit flag for new
  windows created in that session (like "remain-by-default" used to do). Not
  perfectly happy about this, but until I can think of a good way to introduce
  it generically (maybe a set of options in the session) this will do. Fixes
  SF request 2527847.

07 March 2009

* Support for 88 colour terminals.
* break-pane command to create a new window using an existing pane.

02 March 2009

* Make escape key timer work properly so escape+key can be used without
  lightning fast key presses.

13 February 2009

* Redo mode keys slightly more cleanly and apply them to command prompt
  editing. vi or emacs mode is controlled by the session option status-keys.

12 February 2009

* Looking up argv[0] is expensive, so just use p_comm for the window name which
  is good enough. Also increase name update time to 500 ms.

11 February 2009

* Only use ri when actually at the top of the screen; just move the cursor up
  otherwise.
* FreeBSD's console wraps lines at $COLUMNS - 1 rather than $COLUMNS (the
  cursor can never be beyond $COLUMNS - 1) and does not appear to support
  changing this behaviour, or any of the obvious possibilities (turning off
  right margin wrapping, insert mode). This is irritating, most notably because
  it impossible to write to the very bottom-right of the screen without
  scrolling. To work around this, if built on FreeBSD and run with a "cons"
  $TERM, the bottom-right cell on the screen is omitted.
* Emulate scroll regions (slowly) to support the few terminals which don't have
  it (some of which don't really have any excuse).

10 February 2009

* No longer redraw the status line every status-interval unless it has actually
  changed.

08 February 2009

* Don't treat empty arguments ("") differently when parsing configuration
  file/command prompt rather than command line.
* tmux 0.7 released.

03 February 2009

* New command, copy-buffer (alias copyb), to copy a session paste buffer to
  another session.

01 February 2009

* The character pair #(command) may now contain (escaped) right parenthesis.

30 January 2009

* . now bound to "command-prompt 'move-window %%'" by default, from joshe.

29 January 2009

* Window options to set status line fg, bg and attributes for a single
  window. Options are: window-status-fg, window-status-bg,
  window-status-attr. Set to "default" to use the session status colours.

  This allows quite neat things like:

	$ cat ~/bin/xssh
	#!/bin/sh

	if [ ! -z "$TMUX" ]; then
	case "$1" in
    	natalya)
	        tmux setw window-status-fg red >/dev/null
		;;
	natasha)
        	tmux setw window-status-fg yellow >/dev/null
		;;
	esac
	fi
	ssh "$@"
	[ ! -z "$TMUX" ] && tmux setw -u window-status-fg >/dev/null
	$ alias ssh="~/bin/xssh"

* Support #(command) in status-left, and status-right, which is displayed as
  the first line of command's output (e.g. set -g status-right
  "#(whoami)@#(hostname -s)"). Commands with )s aren't supported.

28 January 2009

* Support mouse in copy mode to move cursor. Can't do anything else at the
  moment until other mouse modes are handled.
* Better support for at least the most common variant of mouse input: parse it
  and adjust for different panes. Also support mouse in window/session choice
  mode.

27 January 2009

* Bring back the fancy window titles with session/window names: it is easy to
  work around problems with elinks (see FAQ).
* -u flag to scroll-mode and copy-mode to start scrolled one page
  up. scroll-mode -u is bound to prefix,page-up (ppage) by default.
* Allow status, mode and message attributes to be changed by three new options:
  status-attr, mode-attr, message-attr. A comma-separated list is accepted
  containing: bright, dim, underscore, blink, reverse, hidden, italics, for
  example:

	set -g status-attr bright,blink

  From Josh Elsasser, thanks!

26 January 2009

* Be more clever about picking the right process to create the window name.
* Don't balls up the terminal on UTF-8 combined characters. Don't support them
  properly either - they are just discarded for the moment.

25 January 2009

* load-buffer command

23 January 2009

* Use reverse colours rather than swapping fg and bg for message, mode and
  status line. This makes these usable on black and white terminals.
* Better error messages when creating a session or window fails.
* Oops. Return non-zero on error. Reported by Will Maier.

21 January 2009

* Handle SIGTERM (and kill-server which uses it), a bit more neatly - tidy
  up properly and print a nicer message. Same effect though :-).
* new-window now supports -k to kill target window if it exists.
* Bring back split-window -p and -l options to specify the height a percentage
  or as a number of lines.
* Make window and session choice modes allow you to choose items in vi keys
  mode (doh!). As a side-effect, this makes enter copy selection (as well
  as C-w/M-w) when using emacs keys in copy mode. Reported by merdely.

20 January 2009

* Darwin support for automatic-rename from joshe; Darwin doesn't seem to have
  a sane method of getting argv[0] and searching for the precise insane way
  is too frustrating, so this just uses the executable name.
* Try to change the window title to match the command running it in. This is
  done by reading argv[0] from the process group leader of the group that owns
  the tty (tcgetpgrp()). This can't be done portably so some OS-dependent code
  is introduced (ugh); OpenBSD, FreeBSD and Linux are supported at the moment.

  A new window flag, automatic-rename, is available: if this is set to off, the
  window name is not changed. Specifying a name with the new-window,
  new-session or rename-window commands will automatically set this flag to off
  for the window in question. To disable it entirely set the option to off
  globally (setw -g automatic-rename off).

19 January 2009

* Fix various stupid issues when the status line is turned off. Grr.
* Use reverse attributes for clock and cursor, otherwise they do not
  appear on black and white terminals.
* An error in a command sequence now stops execution of that sequence.
  Internally, each command code now passes a return code back rather than
  talking to the calling client (if any) directly.
* attach-session now tries to start the server if it isn't already started - if
  no sessions are created in .tmux.conf this will cause an error.
* Clean up starting server by making initial client get a special socketpair.

18 January 2009

* Unbreak UTF-8.
* -a flag to next-window and previous-window to select the next or previous
  window with activity or bell. Bound to M-n and M-p.
* find-window command to search window names, titles and visible content (but
  not history) for a string. If only one is found, the window is selected
  otherwise a choice list is shown. This (as with the other choice commands)
  only works from a key. Bound to "f" by default.
* Cleaned up command printing code, also enclose arguments with spaces in "s.
* Added command sequences. These are entered by separating each argument by a ;
  argument (spaces on both sides), for example:

	lsk ; lsc

  To use a literal ; as the argument prefix it with \, for example:

	bind x lsk \; lsc

  Commands are executed from left to right. Also note that command sequences do
  not support repeat-time repetition unless all commands making up the sequence
  support it.
* suspend-client command to suspend a client. Don't try to background it
  though...
* Mark attached sessions in sessions lists. Suggested by Simon Kuhnle.

17 January 2009

* tmux 0.6 released.

15 January 2009

* Support #H for hostname and #S for session name in status-left/right.
* Two new commands, choose-window and choose-session which work only when bound
  to a key and allow the window or session to be selected from a list. These
  are now bound to "w" and "s" instead of the list commands.

14 January 2009

* Rework the prefix-time stuff. The option is now called repeat-time and
  defaults to 500 ms. It only applies to a small subset of commands, currently:
  up-pane, down-pane, next-window, previous-window, resize-pane-up,
  resize-pane-down. These are the commands for which it is obviously useful,
  having it for everything else was just bloody annoying.
* The alt-up and alt-down keys now resize a pane by five lines at a time.
* switch-pane is now select-pane and requires -p to select a pane. The
  "o" key binding is changed to down-pane.
* up-pane and down-pane commands, bound to arrow up and down by default.
* Multiple vertical window splitting. Minimum pane size is four lines, an
  (unhelpful) error will be shown if attempting to split a window with less
  that eight lines. If the window is resized, as many panes are shown as can
  fit without reducing them below four lines. There is (currently!) not a way
  to show a hidden pane without making the window larger.

  Note the -p and -l options to split-window are now gone, these may reappear
  once I think them through again.
* Server locking on inactivity (lock-after-time) is now disabled by default.

13 January 2009

* kill-pane command.

12 January 2009

* command-prompt now accepts a single argument, a template string. Any
  occurrences of %% in this string are replaced by whatever is entered at the
  prompt and the result is executed as a command. This allows things like (now
  bound by default):

  	 bind , command-prompt "rename-window %%"

  Or my favourite:

         bind x command-prompt "split-window 'man %%'"

* Option to set prefix time, allowing multiple commands to be entered without
  pressing the prefix key again, so long as they each typed within this time of
  each other.
* Yet more hacks for key handling. Think it is just about working now.
* Two commands, resize-pane-up and resize-pane-down to resize a pane.
* Make the window pane code handle panes of different sizes, and add a -l
  and -p arguments to split-window to specify the new window size in lines
  or as a percentage.

11 January 2009

* Vertical window splitting. Currently can only split a window into two panes.
  New split-window command splits (bound to ") and switch-pane command (bound to
  o) switches between panes.

  close-pane, swap-pane commands are to follow. Also to come are pane resizing,
  >2 panes, the ability to break a pane out to a full window and vice versa and
  possibly horizontal splitting.

  Panes are subelements of windows rather than being windows in their own
  right. I tried to make them windows (so the splitting was at the session or
  client level) but this rapidly became very complex and invasive. So in the
  interests of having something working, I just made it so each window can have
  two child processes instead of one (and it still took me 12 hours straight
  coding). Now the concept is proven and much of the support code is there,
  this may change in future if more flexibility is needed.
* save-buffer command, from Tiago Cunha.

10 January 2009

* New option, lock-after-time. If there is no activity in the period specified
  by this option (in seconds), tmux will lock the server. Default is 1800 (30
  minutes), set to 0 to disable.
* Server locking. Two new commands: set-password to set a password (a
  preencrypted password may be specified with -c); and lock-server to lock the
  server until the password is entered. Also an additional command line flag,
  -U, to unlock from the shell. The default password is blank (any password
  accepted). If specifying an encrypted password from encrypt(1) in .tmux.conf
  with -c, don't forget to enclose it in single-quotes (') to prevent shell
  variable expansion.
* If a window is created from the command line, tmux will now use the same
  current working directory for the new process. A new default-path option to
  sets the working directory for processes created from keys or interactively
  from the prompt.
* New mode to display a large clock. Entered with clock-mode command (bound to
  C-b t by default); two window options: clock-mode-colour and clock-mode-style
  (12 or 24). This will probably be used as the basis for window locking.
* New command, server-info, to show some server information and terminal
  details.

09 January 2009

* Stop using ncurses variables and instead build a table of the codes we want
  into an array for each terminal type. This makes the code a little more
  untidy in places but gets rid of the awful global variables and calling
  setterm all the time, and shoves all the ncurses-dependent mess into a single
  file, tty-term.c. It also allows overriding single terminal codes, this is
  used to fix rxvt on some platforms (where it is missing dch) and in future
  may allow user customisation a la vim.
* Update key handling code. Simplify, support ctrl properly and add a new
  window option (xterm-keys) to output xterm key codes including ctrl and,
  if available, alt and shift.

08 January 2009

* If built without DEBUG (the release versions), don't cause a fatal error if
  the grid functions notice an input error, just log and ignore the
  request. This might mean me getting shouted at less often when bugs kill
  long-running sessions, at least in release versions.
* Hopefully fix cursor out-of-bounds checking when writing to grid. When I
  wrote the code I must have forgotten that the cursor can be one cell off the
  right of the screen (yes, I know), so there were number of out-of-bounds/
  overflow problems.

07 January 2009

* New flag to set and setw, -u, to unset an option (allowing it to inherit from)
  the global options again.
* Added more info messages for options changes.
* A bit of tidying and reorganisation of options code.

06 January 2009

* Don't crash when backspacing if cursor is off the right of the screen,
  reported by David Chisnall.
* Complete words at any point inside command in prompt, also use option name
  as well as command names.
* Per-client prompt history of up to 100 items.
* Use a splay tree for key bindings instead of an array. As a side-effect this
  sorts them when listed.

22 December 2008

* Use the right keys for home and end.

20 December 2008

* Add vim mode for tmux configuration file to examples/, from Tiago Cunha.

15 December 2008

* New command, source-file (alias source), to load a configuration
  file. Written by Tiago Cunha, many thanks.

13 December 2008

* Work around lack of dch. On Linux, the rxvt termcap doesn't have it (it is
  lying, but we can't really start disbelieving termcaps...). This is a bit
  horrible - I can see no way to do it without pretty much redrawing the whole
  line, but it works...

10 December 2008

* glibc's getopt(3) is useless: it is not POSIX compliant without jumping
  through non-portable hoops, and the method of resetting it is unclear (the
  man page on my system says set optind to 1, but other sources say 0). So,
  import OpenBSD's getopt_long.c into compat/ for use on Linux and use the
  clearly documented optreset = optind = 1 method. This fixes some strange
  issues with command parsing (getting the syntax wrong would prevent any
  further commands being parsed).

06 December 2008

* Bring set/setw/show/showw into line with other commands. This means that by
  default they now affect the current window (if any); the new -g flag must be
  passed to set the global options. This changes the behaviour of set/show and
  WILL BREAK CURRENT CONFIGURATIONS.

  In summary, whether in the configuration file, the command prompt, or a key
  binding, use -g to set a global option, use -t to specify a particular window
  or session, or omit both to try and use the current window or session.

  This makes set/show a bit of a pain but is the correct behaviour for
  setw/showw and is the same as every other command, so we can put up with a
  bit of pain for consistency.
* Redo window options. They now work in the same way to session options with a
  global options set. showw/setw commands now have similar syntax to show/set
  (including the ability to use abbreviations).

  PLEASE NOTE this includes the following configuration-breaking changes:

  - remain-by-default is now GONE, use "setw -g remain-on-exit" to apply the
    global window option instead;
  - mode-keys is now a window option rather than session - use "setw [-g]
    mode-keys" instead of set.

  There are also some additions:

  - message-fg and message-bg session options to control status line message
    colours;
  - mode-fg and mode-bg window options to set colours in window modes such as
    copy mode.

  The options code still a mess and now there is twice as much of it :-(.

02 December 2008

* Add support for including the window title in status-left or status-right
  strings by including the character pair "#T". This may be prefixed with
  a number to specify a maximum length, for example "#24T" to use at most
  24 characters of the title.
* Introduce two new options, status-left-length and status-right-length,
  control the maximum length of left and right components of the status bar.
* elinks (and possibly others) bypass the terminal and talk directly to X to
  restore the window title when exiting. tmux can't know about this particular
  bit of stupidity so the title ends up strange - the prefix isn't terribly
  important and elinks is quite useful so just get rid of it.

27 November 2008

* Tweaks to support Dragonfly.

17 November 2008

* tmux 0.5 released.

16 November 2008

* New window option: "utf8"; this must be on (it is off by default) for UTF-8
  to be parsed. The global/session option "utf8-default" controls the setting
  for new windows.

  This means that by default tmux does not handle UTF-8. To use UTF-8 by
  default it is necessary to a) "set utf8-default on" in .tmux.conf b) start
  tmux with -u on any terminal which support UTF-8.

  It seems a bit unnecessary for this to be a per-window option but that is
  the easiest way to do it, and it can't do any harm...
* Enable default colours if op contains \033[39;49m, based on a report from
  fulvio ciriaco.

12 November 2008

* Keep stack of last windows rather than just most recent; based on a diff from
  joshe.

04 November 2008

* Don't try to redraw status line when showing a prompt or message; if it does,
  the status timer is never reset so it redraws on every loop. Spotted by
  joshe.

09 October 2008

* Translate 256 colours into 16 if 256 is not available, same as screen does.
* Better support for OSC command (only to set window title now), and also
  support using APC for the same purpose (some Linux default shell profiles do
  this).

25 September 2008

* Large internal rewrite to better support 256 colours and UTF-8. Screen data
  is now stored as single two-way array of structures rather than as multiple
  separate arrays. Also simplified a lot of code.

  Only external changes are three new flags, -2, -d and -u, which force tmux to
  assume the terminal supports 256 colours, default colours (useful for
  xterm-256color which lacks the AX flag), or UTF-8 respectively.

10 September 2008

* Split off colour conversion code from screen code.

09 September 2008

* Initial UTF-8 support. A bit ugly and with a limit of 4096 UTF-8
  characters per window.

08 September 2008

* 256 colour support. tmux attempts to autodetect the terminal by looking
  both at what ncurses reports (usually wrong for xterm) and checking if
  the TERM contains "256col". For xterm TERM=xterm-256color is needed (as
  well as a build that support 256 colours); this seems to work for rxvt
  as well. On non-256 colour terminals, high colours are translated to white
  foreground and black background.

28 August 2008

* Support OS X/Darwin thanks to bsd-poll.c from OpenSSH. Also convert
  from clock_gettime(2) to gettimeofday(2) as OS X doesn't support the
  former; microsecond accuracy will have to be sufficient ;-).

07 August 2008

* Lose some unused/useless wrapper functions.

25 July 2008

* Shell variables may now be defined and used in configuration file. Define
  variables with:

	VAR=1

  And use with:

        renamew ${VAR}
	renamew "x${VAR}x"

 Also some other fixes to make, for example, "abc""abc" work similarly to
 the shell.

24 July 2008

* Finally lose inconsistently-used SCREEN_DEF* defines.
* If cursor mode is on, switch the arrow keys from \033[A to \033OA.
* Support the numeric keypad in both application and numbers mode. This is
  different from screen which always keeps it in application mode.

19 July 2008

* Unbreak "set status" - tmux thought it was ambiguous, reported by rivo nurges.

02 July 2008

* Split vi and emacs mode keys into two tables and add an option (mode-keys)
  to select between them. Default is emacs, use,

     tmux set mode-keys vi

  to change to vi.

  vi mode uses space to start selection, enter to copy selection and escape
  to clear selection.

01 July 2008

* Protocol versioning. Clients which identify as a different version from the
  server will be rejected.
* tmux 0.4 released.

29 June 2008

* Zombie windows. These are not closed when the child process dies. May be
  set for a window with the new "remain-on-exit" option; the default setting
  of this flag for new windows may be set with the "remain-by-default" session
  option.

  A window may be restarted with the respawn-window command:

  	respawn-window [-k] [command]

  If -k is given, any existing process running in the window is killed;
  if command is omitted, the same command as when the window was first
  created is used.

27 June 2008

* Handle nonexistent session or client to -t properly.

25 June 2008

* select-prompt command to allow a window to be selected at a prompt. Only
  windows in the current session may be selected. Bound to ' by default.
  Suggested by merdely.
* move-window command. Requested by merdely.
* Support binding alt keys (prefixed with M-). Change default to use
  C- for ctrl keys (^ is still accepted as an alternative).
* Slim down default key bindings: support lowercase only.
* Handle escaped keys properly (parse eg \033b into a single key code) and
  use this to change copy mode next/previous work to M-f and M-b to match
  emacs.

24 June 2008

* Next word (C-n/w) and previous word (C-b/b) in copy mode.

23 June 2008

* list-commands command (alias lscm).
* Split information about options into a table and use it to parse options
  on input (allowing abbreviations) and to print them with show-options
  (meaning that bell-action gets a proper string). This turned out a bit ugly
  though :-/.

22 June 2008

* Do not translate black and white into default if the terminal supports
  default colours. This was nice to force programs which didn't use default
  colours to be properly transparent in rxvt/aterm windows with a background
  image, but it causes trouble if someone redefines the default foreground and
  background (to have black on white or something).

21 June 2008

* Naive tab completion in the command prompt. This only completes command
  names if a) they are at the start of the text b) the cursor is at
  the end of the text c) the text contains no spaces.
* Only attempt to set the title where TERM looks like an xterm (contains
  "xterm", "rxvt" or is "screen"). I hate this but I don't see a better way:
  setting the title actually kills some other terminals pretty much dead.
* Strip padding out of terminfo(5) strings. Currently the padding is just
  ignored, this may need to be altered if there are any software terminals
  out there that actually need it.

20 June 2008

* buffer-limit option to set maximum size of buffer stack. Default is 9.
* Initial buffer improvements. Each session has a stack of buffers and each
  buffer command takes a -b option to manipulate items on the stack. If -b
  is omitted, the top entry is used. The following commands are currently
  available:

	set-buffer [-b index] [-t target-session] string
	paste-buffer [-d] [-b index] [-t target-window]
	delete-buffer [-b index] [-t target-session]
	show-buffers [-t target-session]
	show-buffer [-b index] [-t target-session]

  -d to paste-buffer deletes the buffer after pasting it.
* New option, display-time, sets the time status line messages stay on screen
  (unless a key is pressed). Set in milliseconds, default is 750 (0.75 seconds).
  The timer is only checked every 100 ms or so.

19 June 2008

* Use "status" consistently for status line option, and prefix for "prefix" key
  option.
* Allow commands to be entered at a prompt. This is triggered with the
  command-prompt command, bound to : by default.
* Show status messages properly, without blocking the server.

18 June 2008

* New option, set-titles. On by default, this attempts to set the window title
  using the \e]2;...\007 xterm code.

  Note that elinks requires the STY environment variable (used by screen) to be
  set before it will set the window title. So, if you want window titles set by
  elinks, set STY before running it (any value will do). I can't do this for all
  windows since setting it to an invalid value breaks screen.
* Show arrows at either end of status line when scrolled if more windows
  exist. Highlight the arrow if a hidden window has activity or bell.
* Scroll the status line to show the current window if necessary. Also handle
  windows smaller than needed better (show a blank status line instead of
  hanging or crashing).

17 June 2008

* tmux 0.3 released.

16 June 2008

* Add some information messages when window options are changed, suggested by
  Mike Erdely. Also add a -q command-line option to suppress them.
* show-window-options (showw) command.

15 June 2008

* show-options (show) command to show one or all options.

14 June 2008

* New window options: force-width and force-height. This will force a window
  to an arbitrary width and height (0 for the default unlimited). This is
  neat for emacs which doesn't have a sensible way to force hard wrapping at 80
  columns. Also, don't try to be clever and use clr_eol when redrawing the
  whole screen, it causes trouble since the redraw functions are used to draw
  the blank areas too.
* Clear the blank area below windows properly when they are smaller than client,
  also add an indicator line to show the vertical limit.
* Don't die on empty strings in config file, reported by Will Maier.

08 June 2008

* Set socket mode +x if any sessions are attached and -x if not.

07 June 2008

* Make status-interval actually changeable.

06 June 2008

* New window option: aggressive-resize. Normally, windows are resized to the
  size of the smallest attached session to which they are linked. This means a
  window only changes size when sessions are detached or attached, or they are
  linked or unlinked from a session. This flag changes a window to be the size
  of the smallest attached session for which it is the current window - it is
  resized every time a session changes to it or away from it. This is nice for
  things that handle SIGWINCH well (like irssi) and bad for things like shells.
* The server now exits when no sessions remain.
* Fix bug with inserting characters with TERM=xterm-color.

05 June 2008

* Completely reorganise command parsing. Much more common code in cmd-generic.c
  and a new way of specifying windows, clients or sessions. Now, most commands
  take a -t argument, which specifies a client, a session, or a window target.
  Clients and sessions are given alone (sessions are fnmatch(3)d and
  clients currently not), windows are give by (client|session):index. For
  example, if a user is in session "1" window 0 on /dev/ttypi, these should all
  be equivalent:

	tmux renamew newname			(current session and window)
	tmux renamew -t: newname		(current session and window)
	tmux renamew -t:0 newname		(current session, window 0)
	tmux renamew -t0 newname		(current session, window 0)
	tmux renamew -t1:0 newname		(session 1, window 0)
	tmux renamew -t1: newname		(session 1's current window)
	tmux renamew -t/dev/ttypi newname	(client /dev/ttypi's current
						 session and window)
	tmux renamew -t/dev/ttypi: newname	(client /dev/ttypi's current
						 session and window)
	tmux renamew -t/dev/ttypi:0 newname	(client /dev/ttypi's current
						 session, window 0)

  This does have some downsides, for example, having to use -t on selectw,

	tmux selectw -t7

  is annoying. But then using non-flagged arguments would mean renaming the
  current window would need to be something like:

	tmux renamew : newname

  It might be better not to try and be so consistent; comments to the usual
  address ;-).
* Infrastructure for printing arguments in list-keys output. Easy ones only for
  now.

04 June 2008

* Add some vi(1) key bindings in copy mode, and support binding ^[, ^\, ^]
  ^^ and ^_. Both from/prompted by Will Maier.
* setw monitor-activity and set status without arguments now toggle the current
  value; suggested by merdely.
* New command set-window-option (alias setw) to set the single current window
  option: monitor-activity to determine whether window activity is shown in
  the status bar for that window (default off).
* Change so active/bell windows are inverted in status line.
* Activity monitoring - window with activity are marked in status line. No
  way to disable this/filter windows yet.
* Brought select-window command into line with everything else; it now uses
  -i for the window index.
* Strings to display on the left and right of the status bar may now be set
  with the status-left and status-right options. These are passed through
  strftime(3) before being displayed. The status bar is automatically updated
  at an interval set by the status-interval option. The default is to display
  nothing on the left and the date and time on the left; the default update
  interval is 15 seconds.

03 June 2008

* Per session options. Setting options without specifying a session sets the
  global options as normal (global options are inherited by all sessions);
  passing -c or -s will set the option only for that session.
* Because a client has a session attached, any command needing a session can
  take a client and use its session. So, anything that used to accept -s now
  accepts -c as well.
* -s to specify session name now supports fnmatch(3) wildcards; if multiple
  sessions are found, or if no -s is specified, the most newly created is used.
* If no command is specified, assume new-session. As a byproduct, clean up
  command default values into separate init functions.
* kill-server command.

02 June 2008

* New command, start-server (alias "start"), to start the tmux server and do
  nothing else. This is good if you have a configuration file which creates
  windows or sessions (like me): in that case, starting the server the first
  time tmux new is run is bad since it creates a new session and window (as
  it is supposed to - starting the server is a side-effect).

  Instead, I have a little script which does the equivalent of:

  	tmux has -s0 2>/dev/null || tmux start
  	tmux attach -d -s0

  And I use it to start the server if necessary and attach to my primary
  session.
* Basic configuration file in ~/.tmux.conf or specified with -f. This is file
  contains a set of tmux commands that are run the first time the server is
  started. The configuration commands are executed before any others, so
  if you have a configuration file that contains:

	new -d
	neww -s0

  And you do the following without an existing server running:

	tmux new

  You will end up with two sessions, session 0 with two windows (created by
  the configuration file) and your client attached to session 1 with one
  window (created by the command-line command). I'm not completely happy with
  this, it seems a little non-obvious, but I haven't yet decided what to do
  about it.

  There is no environment variable handling or other special stuff yet.

  In the future, it might be nice to be able to have per-session configuration
  settings, probably by having conditionals in the file (so you could, for
  example, have commands to define a particular window layout that would only
  be invoked if you called tmux new -smysession and mysession did not already
  exist).
* BIG CHANGE: -s and -c to specify session name and client name are now passed
  after the command rather than before it. So, for example:

	tmux -s0 neww

  Becomes:

	tmux neww -s0

  This is to allow them to be used in the (forthcoming) configuration file
  THIS WILL BREAK ANY CURRENT SCRIPTS OR ALIASES USING -s OR -c.

01 June 2008

* Bug fix: don't die if -k passed to link-window and the destination doesn't
  exist.
* New command, send-keys, will send a set of keys to a window.

31 May 2008

* Fix so tmux doesn't hang if the initial window fails for some reason. This
  was highlighted by problems on Darwin, thanks to Elias Pipping for the report
  and access to a test account. (tmux still won't work on Darwin since its
  poll(2) is broken.)

02 January 2008

* Don't attempt to reset the tty on exit if it has been closed externally.

06 December 2007

* Restore checks for required termcap entries and add a few more obvious
  emulations.
* Another major reorganisation, this time of screen handling. A new set of
  functions, screen_write_*, are now used to write to a screen and a tty
  simultaneously. These are used by the input parser to update the base
  window screen and also by the different modes which now interpose their own
  screen.

30 November 2007

* Support \ek...\e\ to set window name.

27 November 2007

* Enable/disable mouse when asked, if terminal claims to support it. Mouse
  sequences are just passed through unaltered for the moment.
* Big internal reorganisation. Rather than leaving control of the tty solely in
  the client and piping all data through a socket to it, change so that the
  server opens the tty again and reads and writes to it directly. This avoids
  a lot of buffering and copying. Also reorganise the redrawing stuff so that
  everything goes through screen_draw_* - this makes the code simpler, but
  still needs broken up more, and all the ways of writing to screens should be
  more consistent.

26 November 2007

* Rather than shifting up one line at a time once the history is full,
  shift by 10% of the history each time. This is faster.
* Add ^A and ^E to copy mode to move to start-of-line/end-of-line.

24 November 2007

* Support for alt charset mode (VT100 graphics characters).

23 November 2007

* Mostly complete copy & paste. Copy mode entered with C-b [ (copy-mode
  command). In copy mode, arrow keys/page up/page down/hjkl/C-u/C-f navigate,
  space or C-space starts selection, and enter or C-w copies and (important!)
  exits copy mode. C-b ] (paste-buffer) pastes into current window. No
  extra utility keys (bol/eol/clear selection/etc), only one single buffer,
  and no buffer manipulation commands (clear/view/etc) yet. The code is also
  fugly :-(.
* history-limit option to set maximum history. Does not apply retroactively to
  existing windows! Lines take up a variable amount of space, but a reasonable
  guess for an 80-column terminal is 250 KB per 1000 lines (of history used,
  an empty history takes no space).

21 November 2007

* Create every line as zero length and only expand it as data is written,
  rather than creating at full size immediately.
* Make command output (eg list-keys) go to a scrollable window similar to
  scroll mode.
* Redo screen redrawing so it is a) readable b) split into utility functions
  that can be used outside screen.c. Use these to make scroll mode only
  redraw what it has to which gets rid of irritating flickering status box and
  makes it much faster.
* Full line width memory and horizontal scrolling in history.
* Initial support for scroll history. = to enter scrolling mode, and then
  vi keys or up/down/pgup/pgdown to navigate. Q to exit. No horizontal history
  yet (need per-line sizes) and a few kinks to be worked out (resizing while in
  history mode will probably cause trouble).

20 November 2007

* Fix format string error with "must specify a client" message. Also
  sprinkle some printflike tags.
* tmux 0.1 released.

17 November 2007

* (nicm) Add -k option to link-window to kill target window if it exists.

16 November 2007

* (nicm) Split in-client display into two columns. This is a hack but not a lot
  more so than that bit is already and it helps with lots of keys.
* (nicm) switch-client command to switch client between different sessions. This
  is pretty cool:

	$ tmux bind q switch 0
	$ tmux bind w switch 1

  Then you can switch between sessions 0 and 1 with a key :-).
* (nicm) Accept "-c client-tty" on command line to allow client manipulation
  commands, and change detach-/refresh-session to detach-/refresh-client (this
  loses the -a behaviour, but at some point -session versions may return, and
  -c will allow fnmatch(3)).
* (nicm) List available commands on ambiguous command.

12 November 2007

* (nicm) If the terminal supports default colours (AX present), force black
  background and white foreground to default. This is useful on transparent
  *terms for programs which don't do it themselves (like most(1)).
* (nicm) Fill in the rest of the man page.
* (nicm) kill-session command.

09 November 2007

* (nicm) C-space is now "^ " not "^@".
* (nicm) Support tab (\011).
* (nicm) Initial man page outline.
* (nicm) -V to show version.
* (nicm) rename-session command.

08 November 2007

* (nicm) Check for required terminal capabilities on start.

31 October 2007

* (nicm) Linux port.

30 October 2007

* (nicm) swap-window command. Same as link-window but swaps windows.

26 October 2007

* (nicm) Saving scroll region on \e7 causes problems with ncmpc so I guess
  it is not required.
* (nicm) unlink-window command.
* (nicm) link-window command to link an existing window into another session
  (or another index in the same session). Syntax:

	tmux -s dstname link-window [-i dstidx] srcname srcidx

* (nicm) Redo window data structures. The global array remains, but each per-
  session list is now a RB tree of winlink structures. This disassociates the
  window index from the array size (allowing arbitrary indexes) which still
  allowing windows to have multiple indexes.

25 October 2007

* (nicm) has-session command: checks if session exists.

24 October 2007

* (nicm) Support for \e6n to request cursor position. resize(1) now works.
* (nicm) Support for \e7, \e8 save/restore cursor and attribute sequences.
  Currently don't save mode (probably should). Also change some cases where
  out-of-bound values are ignored to limit them to within range (there are
  others than need to be checked too).

23 October 2007

* (nicm) Lift limit on session name passed with -s.
* (nicm) Show size in session/window lists.
* (nicm) Pass tty up to server when client identifies and add a list-clients
  command to list connected clients.

20 October 2007

* (nicm) Add default-command option and change default to be $SHELL rather than
  $SHELL -l. Also try to read shell from passwd db if $SHELL isn't present.

19 October 2007

* (nicm) -n on new-session is now -s, and -n is now the initial window name.
  This was documented but not implemented :-/.
* (nicm) kill-window command, bound to & by default (because it should be hard
  to hit accidentally).
* (nicm) bell-style option with three choices: "none" completely ignore bell;
  "any" pass through a bell in any window to current; "current" ignore bells
  except in current window. This applies only to the bell terminal signal,
  the status bar always reflects any bells.
* (nicm) Refresh session command.

12 October 2007

* (nicm) Add a warning if $TMUX exists on new/attach.
* (nicm) send-prefix command. Bound to C-b by default.
* (nicm) set status, status-fg, status-bg commands. fg and bg are as a number
  from 0 to 8 or a string ("red", "blue", etc). status may be 1/0, on/off,
  yes/no.
* (nicm) Make status line mark window in yellow on bell.

04 October 2007

* (nicm) -d option to attach to detach all other clients on the same session.
* (nicm) Partial resizing support. Still buggy. A C-b S and back sometimes fixes
  it when it goes wonky.
* (mxey) Added my tmux start script as an example (examples/start-tmux.sh).
* (mxey) New sessions can now be given a command for their first window.
* (mxey) Fixed usage statement for new-window.
* (nicm) attach-session (can't believe I forgot it until now!) and list-windows
  commands.
* (nicm) rename-window and select-window commands.
* (nicm) set-option command (alias set): "tmux set-option prefix ^A".
* (nicm) Key binding and unbinding is back.

03 October 2007

* (nicm) {new,next,last,previous}-window.
* (nicm) Rewrite command handling so commands are much more generic and the
  same commands are used for command line and keys (although most will probably
  need to check how they are called). Currently incomplete (only new/detach/ls
  implemented). Change: -s is now passed before command again!
* (nicm) String number arguments. So you can do: tmux bind ^Q create "blah".
* (nicm) Key binding. tmux bind key command [argument] and tmux unbind key.
  Key names are in a table in key-string.c, plus A is A, ^A is ctrl-A.
  Possible commands are in cmd.c (look at cmd_bind_table).
* (nicm) Move command parsing into the client. Also rename some messages and
  tidy up a few bits. Lots more tidying up needed :-/.

02 October 2007

* (nicm) Redraw client status lines on rename.
* (nicm) Error on ambiguous command.

01 October 2007

* (nicm) Restore window title handling.
* (nicm) Simple uncustomisable status line with window list.

30 September 2007

* (nicm) Window info command for debugging, C-b I.

29 September 2007

* (nicm) Deleting/inserting lines should follow scrolling region. Fix.
* (nicm) Allow creation of detached sessions: "tmux new-session -d".
* (nicm) Permit error messages to be passed back for transient clients like
  rename. Also make rename -i work.
* (nicm) Pass through bell in any window to current.

28 September 2007

* (nicm) Major rewrite of input parser:
	- Lose the old weirdness in favour of a state machine.
	- Merge in parsing from screen.c.
	- Split key parsing off into a separate file.
  This is step one towards hopefully allowing a status line. It requires
  that we output data as if the terminal had one line less than it really does -
  a serious problem when it comes to things like scrolling. This change
  consolidates all the range checking and limiting together which should make
  it easier.
* (mxey) Added window renaming, like "tmux rename [-s session] [-i index] name"

* Split "tmux list" into "tmux list-sessions" (ls) and "list-windows" (lsw).
* New command session selection:
	- if name is specified, look for it and use it if it exists, otherwise
	  error
	- if no name specified, try the current session from $TMUX
	- if $TMUX doesn't exist, and there is only one session, use it,
	  otherwise error

26 September 2007

* Add command aliases, so "ls" is an alias for "list".
* Rename some commands and alter syntax to take options after a la CVS. Also
  change some flags. So:

	tmux -s/socket -nabc new

  Becomes:

	tmux -S/socket new -sabc

* Major tidy and split of client/server code.

* Window list command (C-b W). Started by Maximilian Gass, finished by me.

20 September 2007

* Specify meta via environment variable (META).
* Record last window and ^L key to switch to it. Largely from Maximilian Gass.
* Reset ignored signals in child after forkpty, makes ^C work.
* Wrap on next/previous. From Maximilian Gass.

19 September 2007

* Don't renumber windows on close.

28 August 2007

* Scrolling region (\e[r) support.

27 August 2007

* Change screen.c to work more logically and hopefully fix heap corruption.

09 July 2007

* Initial import to CVS. Basic functions are working, albeit with a couple of
  showstopper memory bugs and many missing features. Detaching, reattaching,
  creating new sessions, listing sessions work acceptably for using with shells.
  Simple curses programs (top, systat, tetris) and more complicated ones (mutt,
  emacs) that don't require scrolling regions (ESC[r) mostly work fine
  (including mutt, emacs). No status bar yet and no key remapping or other
  customisation.
